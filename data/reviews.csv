The Little Mermaid,Jeffrey Peterson,"To begin, Halle Bailey. Remember her name and don’t forget it. From the trailers, to the red carpet, under the sea and above it, she is charismatic, humble, and a songstress.","Sep 7, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Douglas Davidson,"By making a series of small changes and using his experience in adapting musicals (""Chicago""/""Into the Woods""), [director Rob] Marshall crafts a story we know and gives it an entirely different vibe, for better or worse.","Sep 6, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Nadine Whitney,Halle Bailey is by far the best part of Rob Marshall’s 2023 live action movie. She is a luminous talent with an angelic voice. She is without a doubt Ariel with her wide-eyed wonder and teen rebellion.,"Sep 6, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Mini Anthikad-Chhibber,"Another popcorn summer film, this time inviting a dive into the cool CGI waters of Atlantica peppered with shark attacks, shipwrecks and a giant octopus sea witch. Empty calories definitely, but fun all the same","Aug 27, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Lee Zumpe,All the film’s flaws and miscalculations can be forgiven by its most impressive saving grace: Bailey’s performance is as remarkable as it is enchanting.,"Aug 23, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Josh Larsen,...looks like a cheapie commercial for Royal Caribbean Cruises.,"Aug 19, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Max Covill,[Bailey] is absolutely magnetic on the screen and it’s hard to imagine many others being as perfect for the role as she turns out to be.,"Aug 15, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Rick Bentley,"The casting, new songs and overall look aren’t strong enough to promote or weak enough to disparage.","Aug 8, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Tom Shone,"It’s a weird message to be sending children these days: pretend to be something you’re not, keep your trap shut and hope nobody notices the scales.","Aug 2, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,John Serba,Nothing in recent memory feels so much like amalgamated groupthink capital-C Content like this Little Mermaid.,"Jul 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Manuel São Bento,"The Little Mermaid enriches virtually every narrative aspect compared to the original, deepening Ariel and Eric's arcs while exploring the same core themes without losing any of its predecessor's essence.","Jul 25, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Tina Kakadelis,"The Little Mermaid (2023) is the most successful of the live-action Disney remakes. Even with its shortcomings, the heart of the animated film exists within this new version which cannot be said for many other live action remakes.","Jul 25, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Courtney Lanning,"Mostly thanks to the music and dramatic performances from Bailey and McCarthy, ""The Little Mermaid"" goes along swimmingly. And that puts it several strokes ahead of other live-action Disney remakes.","Jul 25, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Jillian Chilingerian,"Although it does not possess the same campy nature as its animated predecessor, The Little Mermaid maintains the emotion of the beloved story through a star-creating performance and emphasis on relationships.","Jul 25, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Michael Cook,"I never saw the original [Disney's Little Mermaid], so I have no frame of reference and can't say if it's better or not. For me, this was a so-so movie...The songs are fun, but didn't have the magic or the heart that you'd expect from Disney.","Jul 24, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Elliott Collins,"Halle Bailey was born to be a Disney Princess INCREDIBLE! The visuals were pretty solid and the songs were great. It’s not without It’s flaws and a bit too long but overall, I’m very excited for everyone to see Halle bring this classic princess to life.","Jul 23, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Sarah Ward,"When 'Under the Sea' echoes against a literal sea of colour, movement, creatures and energy, it's a dazzling Golden Age Hollywood-esque spectacular. There's no escaping the movie's bloat when it's not merrily floating, however.","Jul 22, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,David Griffiths,"It is hard to see too many fans of the original The Little Mermaid being disappointed in this adaption. The classic songs are there, and delivered in unique re-workings, with some extras also thrown in.","Jul 21, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Zach Pope,The Little Mermaid is the perfect movie for newcomers to the story… for adults who love the original they may not feel the magic the same way. One thing everyone should agree on though is Halle Bailey's incredible performance.,"Jul 20, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Brooke Obie,"""Whether Disney will use its profits to pay its writers fairly and invest in original Black stories is yet to be seen. But a win is a win, and we deserve it.""","Jul 20, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Tyler Strandberg,"Among the core characters, Halle Bailey as Ariel and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula truly stand out. Bailey flawlessly embodies the titular character...","Jul 19, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Michael Calleri,"I wish I could write that ‘The Little Mermaid” unreels swimmingly, but I can’t. It's billed as live-action; however, there’s a lot of CGI and the entire enterprise is weighed down by a digitized watery palette that doesn’t look its best.","Jul 18, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Bruce R. Miller,"The new live-action version of “The Little Mermaid” is so stuffed with extraneous characters, lavish orchestrations and special effects, you wonder if there’s room to move. Too many fish in the sea, you might say.","Jul 10, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Kent Garrison,Halley Bailey's star power is the only thing worth your time.,"Jul 8, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Nell Minow,"Parts of this movie are truly enchanting, especially the underwater scenes. The opening moments on Prince Eric’s ship are thrillingly filmed and the “Under the Sea” number is a glorious Busby Berkeley underwater fantasia.","Jul 7, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Chris McCoy,"What, exactly, is the point of trying to redo masterpieces from the golden age of Disney animation with modern CGI tech?","Jun 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Ruben Peralta Rigaud,The Little Mermaid conserves some of the stronger points from the original movie. [Full review in Spanish],"Jun 20, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Maan Jalal,"[Bailey's] voice is incredible and her acting as the adventurous, opinionated and naive Ariel is superb. She is a joy to watch... However, the script, dialogue and editing of the film is another story.","Jun 16, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Brian Gill,Halle Bailey has incredible stage presence and most of the retread material is fine. The real sin here is Disney's continued employment of Rob Marshall.,"Jun 16, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Brett McCracken,"On one hand, it’s just more of the same for Disney: be true to yourself; follow your heart; don’t let anyone stand in your way ... But especially against the backdrop of our current cultural moment, the 2023 Mermaid takes it one step further.","Jun 16, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Wenlei Ma,It’s trying so hard to not upset fans of the original that it often feels like imitation with a couple of adjustments. And that’s about as flat as Flounder’s new-found photorealism.,"Jun 16, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Gemma Creagh,"The teenage protagonists and lengthy run time might exclude smaller children from the equation, but a fun family film is still on the ticket.","Jun 15, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Rosa Parra,"Since the film’s announcement, this mermaid has been swimming against the current of controversy and backlash, but this movie does a good enough job that it grants a viewing.","Jun 9, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Rene Sanchez,Halle Bailey is spectacular in this modern adaptation of Disney's beloved story. A live-action film that preserves the magic of the animated classic while allowing itself to find its own identity. [Full Review in Spanish],"Jun 9, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Sarah Knight Adamson,"The great news about “The Little Mermaid” is that a star has been born in Halle Bailey’s performance, and the lovely singing voice carries the film along with the supporting cast.","Jun 8, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Jackie K. Cooper,It is all a little waterlogged but Bailey andMcCarthy make it spring back to life.,"Jun 8, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Robert Roten,"I enjoyed this remake of “The Little Mermaid,” and I think the live action realism enhances the romance of the story.","Jun 6, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Manuel Betancourt,All the narrative tweaks make it more convoluted than it needs to be... It just made me want to rewatch the original.,"Jun 6, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Claudia Puig,"It's pretty hard to come close to perfection... This is definitely not better than the original, but it doesn't tarnish it, either.","Jun 6, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Marriska Fernandes,"As far as Disney live-action remakes go, this certainly fares better than some of the other entries in recent years.","Jun 6, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Joel Harley,"A transparently corporate exercise in studio-mandated money-spinning, this bloated remake fails to better its beloved source material in any way...","Jun 6, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Sean P. Means,"A betwixt-and-between movie — never recapturing the magic of the 1989 original when it follows too closely, and never quite succeeding in creating anything fresh where it tries to diverge from its predecessor.","Jun 6, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,JD Duran,One of Disney's best live-action remakes so far.,"Jun 5, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Mel Valentin,Broadly unnecessary and only fitfully justified by production values or lead performances ....,"Jun 5, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Matt Hudson,"When it works, it's enjoyable and entertaining…when it doesn’t work, it can be a slog - one that does not justify its overly long runtime. Halle Bailey is a star in the lead role, but the rest of the movie does not live up to her promise.","Jun 5, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Tim Brayton,"An exemplar of the Walt Disney Company's ongoing attempt to take what is beautifully expressive and aesthetically rich about its unmatched canon of animated features stretching back to 1937, and turn it into grey paste","Jun 5, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Jake Peffer,The Little Mermaid (2023) is one of the best Disney live action remakes.,"Jun 5, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Jane Freebury,"The update on the beloved classic Disney animation has a longer run time, harbours some murkier depths with an enhanced sea witch, but it has less of the zing and energy of the original","Jun 5, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Sarah Marrs,"The mermaids look cool, Halle Bailey is great, and the target tween audience might find enough here to satisfy. Adults, though, will be dead bored.","Jun 3, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Susan Granger,"Scuttling, sentimental fantasy, specifically geared to 'woke' 2023, when audiences may want to see a more dutiful, diversity-aware approach to race and gender.","Jun 3, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Sabina Graves,Miranda and Menken’s musical partnership does breathe fresh life into the story with new songs that honor Howard Ashman’s work to give Ariel a voice...,"Jun 3, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Noëlle D. Lilley,"Overall, it’s a visually gorgeous film, buoyed by a strong ingenue in Bailey with enough laughs for the kids and the nostalgic adults—just don’t expect anything new.","Jun 3, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Dann Gire,This remake fails to fix one key criticism of the original Little Mermaid: the sexist message that women must transform themselves to fit into their man's world...,"Jun 3, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Stephen Romei,"Bailey is terrific, a star-to-be, in this update of a 186-year-old fairytale.","Jun 2, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Terence Johnson,"While The Little Mermaid certainly isn’t breaking new ground in the musical department, it manages to be a fun times at the movies and audiences will surely get their fill","Jun 2, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Micheal Compton,"This version lacks the same spark, despite a lot of high energy throughout the song. It just falls flat and serves as a reminder how much inferior this version is to the original.","Jun 2, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Walter Chaw,Is The Little Mermaid good? I have no idea how to answer that question.,"Jun 2, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Jason Shawhan,"Halle Bailey as Ariel is a superb choice, with an expressive voice and a commitment to the role, and Melissa McCarthy as Ursula puts her ankles into it, showing proper respect to both Pat Carroll and the late Divine.","Jun 2, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Mat Brunet,"Is this movie anywhere near as good as the 1989 animated film? Absolutely not. However, this is also not the disaster that some may expect. For what it did on its own, it’s not bad.","Jun 2, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Lisa Trifone,"In theory, this trend of adapting these classics for a new audience with new technology and a contemporary eye is a worthy endeavor. As of yet, though (with the exception of Cinderella), no one tasked with this mission has completed it successfully.","Jun 2, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Linda Cook,"""The Little Mermaid"" creates a splash.","Jun 2, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Joshua Axelrod,"Despite a few notable warts, The Little Mermaid manages to justify its own existence thanks to Bailey’s strong work as Ariel, some technical wizardry and Marshall’s musical acumen.","Jun 1, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Udita Jhunjhunwala,"Rob Marshall's no-risk reboot avoids pushing along conversations of identity, belonging or choice.","Jun 1, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Dwight Brown,"Romantic and social drama ignite this ode to love, tolerance and acceptance.","Jun 1, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Gregg Shapiro,"That epic battle is the film's lowest low point (trust, there are others), in which Marshall forgot he was making a Disney movie and decided to dabble in some Marvel mayhem.","Jun 1, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Chase Hutchinson,"The crab does indeed look more like a crab and the fish does indeed look like a fish, but the infinitely more joyous expressiveness of the hand-drawn animation has now been replaced by cold, dead eyes.","Jun 1, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Chris Wasser,"Like many before it, Marshall’s film takes a snappy animated caper and stretches it beyond breaking point. But two of our leads do decent, commendable work. I suppose that’s something, right?","May 31, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Mark McPherson,"Dazzling and wondrous, The Little Mermaid makes a solid transition to become a part of Disney’s live-action world of remakes.","May 31, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Kristian M. Lin,"Bailey is hampered by a weak subplot about her rebellion against King Triton, and yet she still manages to carry this vehicle easily. This remake would sink without her star quality.","May 31, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Nick Johnston,"The Little Mermaid is devoid of all wonder as if it had been dictated by the higher-ups to do so out of fear that they might, somehow, make a better movie than the original.","May 31, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Rich Cline,"The memorable songs are here, performances are charming and there are flashy visual effects, but director Rob Marshall loses clarity and resonance in the under-lit settings, swooping-shaking camerawork and shredder-style editing.","May 31, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,tt stern-enzi,Melissa McCarthy is incredible... she's a lot of fun.,"May 31, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Erik Kain,This is an absolutely delightful picture and is quite possibly my favorite of all the princess live-action remakes. Much of that is due to the powerful performance -- and singing chops -- of lead Halle Bailey as Ariel.,"May 31, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Sheraz Farooqi,"The Little Mermaid is solid. It’s carried by Halle Bailey incredible vocal performance, which represented the best of the film. Still, like all Disney Remakes, you see diminished returns of the superior animated original.","May 31, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Tom Santilli,"...it doesn't present a good argument for its existence, creatively.","May 31, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Charles Pulliam-Moore,"Halle Bailey’s turn as The Little Mermaid’s Ariel is inspired, but the movie’s lackluster sense of visual magic does her very few favors.","May 31, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Richard Crouse,Feels like something is missing. That’s the magic that made the ink and paint Little Mermaid an enduring classic.,"May 31, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Denise Pieniazek,"... Despite its present effectiveness, this live-action pass doesn't offer new meanings or contributions that will make the film stand the test of time. [Full review in Spanish]","May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,David Sims,"The new Little Mermaid is somehow 135 minutes long, a whopping 52 more than the lean animated version, but it adds almost nothing of note to the mix, largely spending that extra time on stretched-out action sequences and slightly more plot context.","May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Melanie Fischer,"The Little Mermaid is a dank, lethargic cash grab that feels like a glimpse of that bleakest possible future. While David Magee gets credit for the script here, it’s the kind of film that could easily be written by a ChatGPT type program.","May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Carolyn Hinds,"The Little Mermaid is thoroughly enjoyable, owing much of this to Bailey’s irrepressible charm and crystal clear vocals, and her chemistry with all of her castmates.","May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Mattie Lucas,Bailey is so luminous that it's easy to overlook just how bland everything else around her is.,"May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Lauren Coates,"Thanks to Halle Bailey, Jonah Hauer-King, and some key changes in the script, it’s undoubtedly one of Disney’s most interesting, ambitious remakes yet.","May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,KT Mahe,"Halle Bailey floats to the surface in her heartfelt vocals, vibrant performance and natural charm. While this reimagining had a lot of interesting trinkets, it dulled in comparison to her sparkle and shine.","May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Oti,"Halle Bailey's compelling portrayal of Ariel emerges as a highlight. Her exquisite vocals and perfect embodiment of the character imbue a sense of grace, despite the live-action adaptation's struggle to capture the original's vibrance.","May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Rubén Rosario,It wades into the choppy waters of the current discourse and emerges a lackluster Disney remake with the courage of its convictions.,"May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Edwin Arnaudin,"One of the better Disney live-action remakes, but still suffers from redundancy.","May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Victoria Luxford,"These Disney remakes are like cover versions of songs, so don’t expect it to reinvent the wheel. However, there are some great casting decisions in there.","May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,"An entertaining enough film that justifies its longer runtime with a more detailed focus on its central romance. I don't think it's the definitive version, but it's still a pretty faithful and satisfying and fun adaptation. Full review in Spanish.","May 30, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Erik Childress,"Everything underwater looks like a bad deepfake, each new song is worse than the last, the Under the Sea number is like a Baz Luhrmann vomitorium and an unbearable additional 50 minutes make this an all-around atrocity.","May 29, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Valerie Kalfrin,"Disney’s new live-action take on The Little Mermaid goes along swimmingly in its sweet romance, but it doesn’t diverge enough from its animated roots to truly make a splash. ... adorable enough in parts, but its story largely stays on the surface.","May 29, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Bob Bloom,"'The Little Mermaid' follows the counters of its animated predecessor rather faithfully. It includes a couple of new songs and a bit-too-long, but lively, dance sequence, but they do not detract from the overall production.","May 29, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Bob Grimm,Bailey is terrific but the film around her grows dull and muddy.,"May 29, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Erin Maxwell,"The Little Mermaid will no doubt be a hit for Disney, and they have faith in it, or else it would have been expelled to the Neverland that is Disney+, but it is far from the exceptional experience they presented us back in 1989.","May 29, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Paul Salfen,"This is one for the whole family - any family to enjoy and to sing along to, laugh with, and cry to - it's quite a spectacle.","May 29, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Jordy Sirkin,"With some minor tweaks to breathe new life into the aquatic tale, The Little Mermaid is a vibrant and joyous adaptation.","May 29, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Natasha Alvar,"Are things better under the sea? Not in this live-action remake. There are some great performances though, from Bailey, Hauer-King and McCarthy, which kept things enjoyable.","May 29, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Candice McMillan,"Despite the headlines, The Little Mermaid is a magical reimagining, one that may be too long or too scary for young children, but will surprise and delight older kids and grown fans of the original.","May 29, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Nathalia Aryani,"Vibrantly realized undersea with silky clarity, bursting with energy, color and cuteness. Poignant ending shows what it means to listen to someone's voice and let them find their own destiny. Comes to life with visual and voice, in more ways than one.","May 29, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Tatiana Albandos,"Halle Bailey does a great job taking on the challenging role of Ariel. Some of the visuals, particularly the underwater scenes with floating hair, left a bit to be desired and Melissa McCarthy could've been a bit more soulful as Ursula but it was fine.","May 28, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Mark Kermode,"It’s functionally good-natured rehash fare, bogged down by some watery CG and a few uncomfortable dips into “uncanny valley”, yet buoyed up by Bailey’s winning titular performance.","May 28, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Dennis Schwartz,"A splashy mermaid performance by the vibrant, soulful and pleasant-voiced Halle Bailey.","May 28, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Julian Lytle,"It’s well made to a point, and I think it will probably be great for many people, especially those who really loved the old film or want to see a Black Mermaid Princess.","May 28, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Felix Vasquez Jr.,"If you have any reason to watch this pallid remake of the 1989 film, watch it for Halle Bailey...","May 27, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Rendy Jones,"Halle Bailey. Enough said. Good night, everybody!","May 27, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Doug Walker,"Aside from Bailey's fantastic voice and a few song sequences, this movie feels like imagination in reverse. It limits creativity rather than expands it.","May 27, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Josie Melendez,"Halle Bailey is a revelation. She is the heart and soul of this film, accompanied by wonderful performances by the cast all around. It is a wonderful addition to the story while still honoring the original. It is a treat!","May 27, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Ty Burr,This is what happens when you start thinking of films as “content.”,"May 27, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Richard Propes,A few minor missteps can't erase the fact that The Little Mermaid is one of Disney's best live-action remakes to date and a film that should entertain parents and children alike.,"May 27, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,John Rocha,"The Little Mermaid is a total joy! Halle Bailey delivers a dazzling debut full of tenderness and genuine wonder with a voice that gives new dynamic life to these classic Disney songs. Rob Marshall directs a vibrant, captivating and truly touching film.","May 27, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Kevin Carr,"Imperfect, and too long, the film is saved by Halle Bailey, who shines through.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,John Urbancich,"McCarthy's dazzling replay of ""Poor Unfortunate Souls"" could be counted as the real musical showstopper, despite the top-notch array of other standard ""Mermaid"" tunes updated for the remake, including Oscar-winning Best Song ""Under the Sea.""","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Carla Renata,"Even though this live action remake has a few missteps, Halle Bailey is magical as Ariel . Alongside Melissa McCarthy as a deliciously delectable Ursula, together they make returning ""under the sea"" entertaining and fun for a whole new generation","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Mike McGranaghan,Halle Bailey is a superstar.,"May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Josh Saunders,"It should be applauded for featuring merpeople from all backgrounds, for not airbrushing out Halle's acne scars and for carefully referencing ocean pollution.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Liz Shannon Miller,"This is a story about mermaids and magic and talking fish — it doesn’t need a political angle, or an unexpected family connection… or even an extra 52 minutes of screen time, in the end.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Larushka Ivan-Zadeh,"The new Little Mermaid is no classic but it's a dependable half- term treat... or rather feast, given that it runs for almost an hour longer than the original.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Armond White,Disney transforms its 1989 animated version of Andersen’s story in such a way that its enchantment is deracinated. More care has gone into aquarium-style realism than into considering what the fantasy of otherness means.,"May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Tom Gliatto,"Halle Bailey happens to be perfect: She has a clear, powerful voice -- able to unleash a tsunami of emotions when she sings the anthemic “Part of Your World” -- and her performance is appealingly playful and sweet, even relatable.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Mathew DeKinder,"Still, the positives outweigh the negatives and there are some nice touches that make this reimagining of the classic film worth your time.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Randy Meeks,"Halle Bailey will have to visit a chiropractor, because she alone carries this entire film on her shoulders. [Full review in Spanish]","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,MontiLee Stormer,"While not earth-shattering, The Little Mermaid is a movie to take the whole family to, and my quibbles really are minor.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Murjani Rawls,Just enough elements come together to justify why the retelling of this story works a tad bit better than other Disney attempts.,"May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Ryan Syrek,"Maybe in 30 years, when they do an animated remake of the live-action remake of the animated film, we’ll get a movie as brave as Ariel’s potential message and as entertaining as Bailey clearly is.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Craig D. Lindsey,"Despite all the flavors in the cast, the movie is still disappointingly vanilla.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Steven D. Greydanus,"Suffers from the murky, underlit look common in Disney tentpoles. In underwater sequences the dimness ostensibly approximates realism, but the real function is to camouflage CGI quality issues. Too much fails at a basic level: It’s not worth looking at.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Lisa Johnson Mandell,"There is comfort to be found here, and pure childlike delight. We can set the burdens of the world aside for a few hours and immerse ourselves in a world of creativity, color, music and imagination. There are far worse ways to escape.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Patrick McDonald,"Director Rob Marshall is the key to uplifting the live action lushness, and Halle Bailey shuts down the debate, as her Ariel is luminous. The voices of Daveed Diggs and Awkwafina provides the animal comic relief. And we get to see a MerMan ... MerMan!","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Alex Bentley,"The live-action version of The Little Mermaid ... is a thoroughly pleasant watch with some nice performances, which clears the bar for success for this era of Disney history.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Pravina Rudra,"The Little Mermaid has plenty of neat, ostensibly progressive additions, but it is not the deep reimagining that Ariel’s story deserved.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Christopher Lloyd,Was this live action remake really necessary? Probably not. But the new film retains all of the old magic with plenty of worthy add-ons. And Halle Bailey is a charmer who sings her heart out.,"May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Thelma Adams,"Disney recycles its seawater-soaked Cinderella, now in a live action musical.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Rob Thomas,“The Little Mermaid” wasn’t meant for me. It was meant for the little girl in my row who excitedly yelped “Dad! Mermaids! Dad! Mermaids!” over and over during the first few minutes of the movie.,"May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,James Verniere,Bailey is very good. But this mess is almost one hour longer than the animated original. Mermaids' tales don't get better because they're longer.,"May 26, 2023",critic_review

The Little Mermaid,Francisca Tinoco,"'The Little Mermaid' is not just another useless, soulless remake from the Mouse House. Not only does it give the gift of Halle Bailey as Ariel, but it also fortifies its predecessor's story by adding much needed narrative context and emotional pull.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Johnny Gayzmonic,"While it makes a harder case for its own identity more than most of the other remakes...it ultimately doesn’t rise to the level of truly essential. It’s true what they say: “Life’s full of hard choices, innit it?”","May 26, 2023",critic_review

The Little Mermaid,Peter Travers,"While it can’t match the effortless charm of the 1989 animated classic, this overstuffed live-action echo fills the title role with shining new star Halle Bailey who gives this musical just the oomph it needs—a heart that sings and a spirit that soars.","May 26, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Adam Olinger,"I'm looking forward to the animated remake in a few years. These Disney ""live-action"" movies are pointless, unless the entire point is to just make money.

The Little Mermaid,Candice Frederick,"Yes, to have a Black princess in a major Hollywood film is, sadly, forward-thinking in 2023. But there is nothing innovative or reformist about what happens in this movie.","May 26, 2023",critic_review

The Little Mermaid,M.V. Moorhead,"The idea of re-doing Beauty and the Beast or The Lion King in slick but unconvincing live action seemed, beyond the obvious profit potential, gratuitous. Fine as the performers are, this Little Mermaid seems that way too.","May 26, 2023",critic_review

The Little Mermaid,Chauncey K.

The Little Mermaid,Brent Hankins,"Better than most of Disney's recent spate of remakes, but it's not as if the bar were set especially high.

The Little Mermaid,Brandon Avery,"Halle Bailey cast as Ariel was outstanding. Her voice could move mountains, and all of the song choices were spectacular.

The Little Mermaid,Aaron Neuwirth,"Whether or not this film will have much staying power, it’s doing what it can to be true to the original vision while only mildly getting in the way of itself.

The Little Mermaid,Anthony Morris,It's no secret that the Disney version of The Little Mermaid doesn't have a whole lot in common with Hans Christian Andersen's original. It's a shame they didn't take as many liberties when they decided to remake their own version.,"May 25, 2023",critic_review

The Little Mermaid,Jim Schembri,"The film certainly looks and sounds pretty enough.

The Little Mermaid,Theolin Tembo,"The Little Mermaid is at its simplest the quintessential story of an outsider that everyone can connect with. In this modern retelling, many will walk away having fallen in love with Bailey’s Ariel, and feeling not only seen but also moved by her story.","May 24, 2023",critic_review
The Little Mermaid,Annette,"I give it a 7 out of 10. I definitely enjoyed the movie, mostly well done. I didn't notice or pay much attention to the changed lyrics in the classic songs, so that's not a bother. The actors were well cast for their roles. The new songs were amusing and had meaning. Some scenes looked like they were shot for shot from the animated version, which may or may not be a good thing, since in some parts it felt redundant in that it felt like it was imitating the animated version. Still, I understand wanting to keep some things from the original and not change too much. My favorite change made in the live-action is (spoiler alert) the relationship between Ariel and Eric because they built a bond gradually throughout the movie and made their love believable. This is the reason I would rewatch the movie, because Halle Bailey and Jonah Haur King had great chemistry and I loved watching them together, and the ending is beautiful and innocent, and convincing.","Sep 3, 2023",audience_review

The visuals were beautiful and imaginative especially the different versions of the mermaids. The King's character fell a bit flat. Flounder looked like a bath toy, floating half out the water like that. Ursula was played well. I thought Prince Eric looked a little old for Ariel, especially since they kept calling her ""child"" and reminding us she was such a young girl. Eric looked like a grown man. I think Timothee Chalamet would have been a good alternative. The ending scene with both species was heartwarming. They cast was diverse and I thought the actress playing Queen Mother was perfect in that role. I enjoyed it.","Jul 19, 2023",audience_review

The Little Mermaid,Rosie,"I loved it! I would like to give it a 4.75 but since I cant I had to give it a 5! I wanted to give it a 5 but there were just a couple little things that I wanted to be better. The biggest thing was I thought that the song under the sea was beautiful visually but I really wanted it to be a bigger production musically. Like Sebastian was the only one singing and Ariel sang a little with him at the end and I think the genius to that song is that the whole ocean kind of joins in to persuade her to love the water. So when they are all dancings be stuff with her but they arent singing, it just doesnt completely satisfy the moment. Especially with how big that song is and how iconic, I just really wanted it to be bigger and better. Its sung well and it great but it just needed more voices and more. Bigger! I thought all the other changes they made though were so good! Ursula was incredible! Melissa McCarthy outdid herself. I wish they would have had all the verses of her song in the movie too because she was by far my favorite part! She was scary but hilarious and just sooo good! I loved the added songs! I think they were great! Came at great times in the story! I loved that the mermaid sisters werent just annoying mermaids who sang and did nothing that they were the rulers of the 7 seas! That was such a great thing and so I liked that their song was cut. I loved that the siren song was mentioned. I just really loved everything about it and how true it was to the original but it was still very updated in the same way. Like they stayed true to the big things and changed things that made it better! I thought all the acting was good! It was just really fun! As a huge little mermaid fan I was proud and I also cried! It was great! I was just very picky with the under the sea song!","Jul 9, 2023",audience_review

The Little Mermaid,Maximac,"I can’t imagine anyone not loving this movie unless they have a hateful racist agenda! Today will be my 6th or 7th time seeing it. I plan on seeing it every other weekend until it’s digital release, that I will purchase! I simply loved everything about it, including the 3 new songs. Especially Eric’s and Ariel’s new songs - they fit! I know them to sing along already. I’m trying to think of just one thing I didn’t like - and that is it wasn’t long enough because I wanted more about Ariel’s sisters. Something about her mother. There needs to be a second movie! Worth a big budget and a creative script that puts her sisters and King Triton in it to help them save their daughter. Maybe Eric will encounter his parents, perhaps his father. So much more to add to this delightful and entertaining tale. Positively outstanding!","Jul 6, 2023",audience_review
