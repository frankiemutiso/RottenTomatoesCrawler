The Night of the 12th,Michael Clark,"The filmmakers steal every last boom of their own thunder in fewer than two steps out of the starting gate. Had these sentences appeared at the end of the live-action and before the closing credits, they would have had a monumentally throttling effect.","Aug 12, 2023",critic_review

The Night of the 12th,Farah Cheded,"The film’s treatment of the victim herself — incurious and downright gratuitous in the depiction of her murder — cements it as a shallow, un-self-aware, and failed attempt to reckon with a subject that deserved its full focus.","Aug 4, 2023",critic_review

The Night of the 12th,Sean P. Means,"Moll investigates the emotional states of the cops as doggedly as those cops investigate Clara’s death.

The Night of the 12th,June Butler,The Night of the Twelfth will give viewers reason to reflect on the inhumanity of innocence and the fragility of life. It’s an astounding film and one that is well worth watching.,"Jun 29, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Laura Clifford,"an unconventional police procedural, one in which an unsolved crime haunts its investigators… emotional callousness begins an array of the violent tendencies of too many men toward women which will weigh upon Yohan.","Jun 27, 2023",critic_review

The Night of the 12th,Taylor Baker,In The Night of the 12th the film adaptation of the novel 18.3 – Une année à la PJ by Pauline Guéna director Dominik Moll swaps the intrigue that normally permeates detective tales for an authentic portrayal of the day-to-day events and,"May 21, 2023",critic_review

The Night of the 12th,Jared Mobarak,This police procedural isn't therefore about justice or heroism or even violence. At least not any one isolated from the others. It's a look at the human condition and its tragic flirtation with futility.,"May 19, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Morgan Rojas,"Composer Olivier Margueri’s score offers a beautiful mix of buoyancy sprinkled with melancholy, giving the film its ominous nature.","May 18, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Ethan Vestby,"It’s almost bold of director Dominik Moll and screenwriter Gilles Marchand to center their film so much around both the male perspective and flawed, albeit noble cop protagonists, and intriguing how Night of the 12th flips this on its head.","May 18, 2023",critic_review

The Night of the 12th,Owen Gleiberman,"“The Night of the 12th” is a mostly compelling sit, though what lends the film its singular texture is that it keeps tricking us into thinking it’s a more conventional thriller than it is.","May 5, 2023",critic_review

The Night of the 12th,Dustin Chang,"Gilles Marchant and Dominik Moll, the writer-director team known for tight Hichcockian psychological thrillers over the years, come with The Night of the 12th. It's a policier in the same vein as Memories of Murder and Zodiac.","Apr 3, 2023",critic_review

The Night of the 12th,Archie H,The lead character spends most of his time cycling in a circle going nowhere. That's exactly how you feel having watched the film. Pretentious nonsense. Total waste of time.,"Aug 8, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Yuri M,"O filme é excelente. Quase como um documentário, a história é imersiva e convida o telespectador a participar das angústias vividas pelos personagens ali presentes. O arco do protagonista exibe a vida e a rotina de investigações policiais. Promove importantes reflexões a respeito de comportamentos estruturais da sociedade, de forma leve e sem desviar da história. Uma obra prima.","Aug 7, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Ravenswood R,"Excellent police movie. It covers many themes equally well, has sharp characterization and consistently believable scenes and dialogue. It is dark in general but has great vitality in the story and compelling interactions which keep it lively and brisk, even with the long run time and ""slow"" pace. Humor is present, too, if you catch it. Proves that a nice tidy wrap-up and solving of the crime is not what makes a great movie.","Aug 6, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Richa P,Omg what a disappointing movie this was! It takes you through a whole investigation of a murder - the kind of unsolved murder that haunts investigators. And spoiler alert - it remains unsolved till the end! Like why would you pass on that misery to the audience?? How does this movie have an audience rotten tomato score 98%?? This is absolutely insane! Don't watch this movie.,"Aug 6, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Bruce S,"The movie is not so much a Mystery as a Police Procedural. They pretty much tell you so at the beginning of the show. The acting, direction and filming are great. Just remember that it's based on a true story of an unsolved crime. Also, if you're a french language student this film is great for its easy to understand dialog if you're at level B2 or so.","Jul 15, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Primo 1,"A dark, well crafted gripping movie. A hard -boiled, adaptation of french police procedures, laying out a genuine portrayal of the day to day events and the human condition with its tragic seduction with futility.","Jul 7, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Jeffrey M F,"This was well-acted and well-done overall, but European films like this feel very slow for American viewers who are used to a much faster pace to our story telling.","Jul 4, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Onini C,"""The Night Of The 12TH"" is a gripping thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat. With its clever plot twists and intense performances, it delivers a suspenseful experience that will leave you guessing until the very end. A must-watch!","Jun 19, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,len s,I enjoyed the movie which was based to true events. The acting was good although there were so many characters it was sometimes difficult to remember who was who. Even though I found the ending disappointing it still kept me entertained throughout.,"Jun 15, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Lucas B,"Very interesting, quite captivating, but I had a little trouble with the rhythm. (Bouli Lanners I love you)","Jun 13, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Ghederick Eshmont,Spectacular crime procedural that avoids the Anglo-American psychological/obsessive troupes. Very adept at showing the bureaucratic nature of law enforcement.,"Jun 12, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Roy J,"Good for fans of police procedurals. Otherwise, a little frustrating on what the movie is trying to say. We know from the start the killer won't be found, so is it because of police incompetence or just how life is.","Jun 11, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Tyler G,"Understated and well acted crime investigation movie. Opts for realism over resolution, personal dynamics over standard procedural. The gender commentary overt in the dialogues bridging between multiple scenes and characters felt a bit forced. Overall, okay.","Jun 7, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,eduardo b,"Very good movie, great discussion. A must watch!","May 23, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Jon T,Excellent. I am 67 so seen a lifetime of cop movies/tv shows. This is the best of them if you like realism. Can't say too much about it without giving it away.,"Apr 16, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Natalia R,"It's an excellent and intriguing movie -- Dominik Moll's best movie. Based on the true police investigation of the murder of Maud Maréchal, in Lagny sur Marne -- a suburb outside Paris. The murder took place 10 years ago, May 14 2013. Dominik melanges incriminating evidence and characteristics of all suspects -- perhaps to distract attention from the main suspect and murderer who is still at large -- hopefully not for long. It's based on the book written by Pauline Guéna, 18.3 Une année à PJ. The chapter ""Une vraie victime"" talks about the investigation of Maud Maréchal's murder. In the book her name is Clara, same as in the movie. Pauline spent one year at the police of Versailles headquarters studying police investigations. The Night of the 12 got six Césars this year. Best director, best movie, best adapted screenplay, most promising actor, best supporting actor and best film score.","Apr 8, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Alistair M,Intriguing and movie kept me fully engrossed,"Apr 6, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Phil S,"This is a plausible and well-controlled procedural. It's no spoiler to say that this is a procedure without a positive outcome. That's the premise of the film from the start. But it mixes extreme violence and thoughtful conversations, which are refreshingly naturalistic. There are some excellent scenes which are unhurried, though the film never drags.","Mar 28, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Charles Koplinski,"However, the final scene is on point and the emotional pull of the story is enough to make me forgive River its faults, but by a very narrow margin. 3 Stars","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Nate Adams,"For a remake of a decent through not entirely beloved nineties cable hit, you could do much worse.","Aug 10, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Dennis Schwartz,"It has a good mix of action, suspense and nature scenes.","Aug 9, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Roger Moore,"No, it’s not a font of originality or endless blast of excitement. But “River Wild” does what its inspiration did and manages to move us as much as the Streep and Bacon Curtis Hanson film of 1994 did, and does it in a much shorter thriller.","Aug 5, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Frank Swietek,"Less a remake of the starry 1994 film than a simpler, bare-bones take on the premise of malevolence during a white-water rafting trip, “River Wild” is an efficiently-made but flimsy potboiler about a berserk killer that’s notable only for its location.","Aug 5, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Aaron Neuwirth,"The results are a tense, effective thriller that serves as one of the strongest efforts in the realm of direct-to-home video releases. Stronger than many theatrical thrillers, and some smart casting here as well.","Aug 4, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Natasha Alvar,"River Wild may be a remake of sorts, but it's still very much its own film, with its own charms.","Aug 3, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Randy Myers,A taut exercise with a few teeth-gnashing rafting sequences.,"Aug 2, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Pramit Chatterjee,"River Wild is not a good movie. If you want to watch a group of people go on a deadly and stressful rafting mission, just watch the original 1994 film. I won’t recommend wasting your time on this.","Aug 2, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Eddie Harrison,"…with small-scale action that doesn’t test credulity too much, and terse, committed acting, River Wild is a reasonably taut thriller which keeps you watching…","Aug 2, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Peter Gray,"With a lean running time (no fat present in its 91 minutes), River Wild stirs up enough action and suspense on its own accord to earn itself a rightful emancipation from the very film it draws inspiration from.","Aug 2, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Jennie Kermode,Meester is a strong lead...giving the film some much needed emotional force without oversimplifying it.,"Aug 1, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Mike McGranaghan,"I haven’t seen the original since it came out almost thirty years ago, although I recall having mixed feelings about it. This new one engenders no such ambivalence. It’s an effective little thriller.","Aug 1, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Casey Chong,The otherwise unnecessary reboot gets a gritty and psychological-horror makeover.,"Aug 1, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Danielle Solzman,"River Wild is an unnecessary reimagining of the 1994 thriller, The River Wild...","Aug 1, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Jackie K. Cooper,Nothing like a wild river ride to stir up some action and suspense.,"Aug 1, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Brian Orndorf,"While it doesn’t match the thrills of the 1994 effort, “River Wild” has compelling grimness, refreshing brevity (running 85 minutes), and contains a few surges of panic to keep it involving.","Jul 31, 2023",critic_review
River Wild,Sidney F,"Ok lol, here we go. Note that I have never felt compelled to write a review before this movie. I feel like rotten toms is usually pretty solid. Above an 80%, and I'm down. I saw this was scored at an 84% so naturally I thought it was going to be bomb.. but man was I wrooong. This movie starts out honestly pretty good. But holy shit it just gets worse as it continues, so bad that I think I said ""I hate this movie"" about 30x. Love the OC, love gossip girl, nothing against the actors, but man let me save you an hour and a half- it's pretty bad. Haha hope this helps.","Aug 14, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Marc Z,"Wow-this is surprisingly good. This River adventure movie opens up foreshadowing that it is an homage to Deliverance and it takes the lead from there. The movie borrowers the essential character of John Boorman's great film. Five people start out on a leisurely river rafting adventure that turns into so much more. The acting is solid. The Direction is powerful and well done. Adam Brody and Leighton Meister are very engaging in this one. Taran Killam is really, really good, and it took me almost 30 minutes to figure our it was him in this role. I thought this was a movie about an incident of a ""natural disaster"". It is that, but is much more and I really liked it.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Mike F,"While I feel like this movie was utterly predictable, my wife did say at one point ""this movie is stressing me out!"". There were some tense dramatic scenes but felt the plot was slow developing and then got to over the top very quickly.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,George V,"By far the absolute worst movie I have seen in a while. Terrible acting, script and all around atrocious. Why was it even made!?","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Michael C,Yell-at-the-screen C-List horror movie dumb. Maybe it works if you've never been on a hike or in a fight in your life.,"Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Sebastian V,Everyone in the movie is incredibly stupid not worth the watch,"Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,James,I try not to hate on top many movies but this was So incredibly stupid. Everything about the suspense hinges on the viewer being an idiot. How does such a poorly designed concept ever get made into a movie.,"Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,JonRob 9,"This movie is okay, I am a bit shocked that it has an 82% from the experts. The acting is okay and there are some pretty tense & well-filmed river sequences in a beautiful setting. But, this is a movie where the characters make too many stupid decisions. At one point the antagonist is asleep in the raft holding a gun. Golden opportunity to punch him or her in the side of the head and take it. At another point two people are fighting while the other two cut the ropes off their wrists. Then they run into the woods. Then instead of helping their friend (would have been 3 on 1), they run into the woods. Then there's another scene where person #1 is lying inside the boat while person #2 rafts down some waterfalls, sure enough person #1 goes flying out of the raft. Is there no way to strap him in? You knew the waterfalls were coming.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Chris D,"This was genuinely the worst movie I have ever scene. The acting is terrible, the plot is nauseatingly predictable. The only reason we watched it was because we thought Ben Afleck was in it. Truly terrible. Do not recommend to anyone.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Ben R,"I'm not sure where I can pinpoint my frustration the most with this movie. I won't name the scenes for spoiler alerts, but every decision made by the characters beyond the bad guy were no good dirty rotten pig stealin great great grandfather type decisions. Complete cattywanpusness.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Bud Z,Most unrealistic movie I've seen in a while. Legit think they are bordering spectrum for even being in that situation. Don't waste your time on this movie.,"Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Joseph L,I usually go and read a review before watching something. If it's 50/50 I'll give it a try. This movie was cringe to watch. Acting was pretty rough and the writing ever rougher. Do not waste your time with this one guys and gals. I actually created this rotten tomato account specifically to give this a low rating to maybe save one of you from the torture.,"Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Jerod S,Never trust a guy with face tattoos; furthermore be careful who you go overnight river rafting with. Brother and Sister (Meester) can't control their ex-con friend when things go wrong on the water.,"Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Dallas H,"This film can be considered a reboot of the 1994 movie featuring Meryl Streep, Kevin Bacon, and David Strathairn. While it's a decent watch, I much prefer the original film.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Stenko M,"""River Wild"" falls short of its promise, failing to deliver the gripping adventure it advertised. With a weak plot, underdeveloped characters, and inconsistent pacing, the film struggles to engage its audience. While it's not entirely without merit, it's certainly not the cinematic thrill ride one would hope for in a 2023 adventure film.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Anthony G,Decent plot with some thrills mixed about. Characters not very meaty which makes some of their decision making defy logic at best.,"Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Paul S,It's worth it !! If you're looking for an easy thriller this is it. It's entertaining!,"Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,N/A,"I’m not sure at all how this got great reviews. “River Wild” suffers from dumb characters doing dumb things. For example, the antagonist in the film at one point is asleep holding a gun. If you want him to stop, I don’t know maybe knock him out unconscious and then take the antagonist’s gun. Then he’s no longer a threat. But, the film doesn’t seem smart enough to have characters that think like this. Could’ve been better.","Aug 10, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Chi C,"I liked this movie! Kind of predictable, but still kept me on the edge of my seat.","Aug 10, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Felix T,"This should have been a satire. There was nothing realistic in any of the scenes. What professional reviewer would have enjoyed this movie? It is a rehash of much better movies without any of the character motivations, good acting or believable story arcs. I gave it 72 eye rolls.","Aug 10, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,B P,It's not all that creative or revolutionary but ‘River' Wild' manages to be thrilling enough to warrant a watch.,"Aug 10, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Melissa D,The cast is great and the story makes sense but definitely missed the mark with originality. It's easy to see what's going to happen. It did keep me until the end to see who was going to live.,"Aug 9, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,drew s,"This movie is absolute trash. No film continuity, horrible execution, the characters are the dumbest human beings alive. It was aggravating how bad this was.

River Wild,Fer,"All the actors did great performances, but I have to say that Meester was exceptional. I don't think her character was dumb like everyone says. To me, the movie is more focused on her development, of course she's not going to react against this guy, she knows what he's capable of and she's afraid of him because of their past. It'snt until the end that she faces that fear and fights. And i really liked that.","Aug 8, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,cbcguy,"Drawn out at some parts, skimmed through the first 20-25 minutes because I did not care about the introduction of the characters at all.

Won't be striving to rewatch it but it was a fun ride at some points.","Aug 8, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,SkyRo P,"#MovieReview #RiverWild #Netflix So this movie with the suspense thriller, I had a lot of suspense and a lot of action in this movie. It's OK, it has some good moments, and some bad moments, and most of the time the movie is really drawn out, with a lot of dialogue, and not much action And then there are so many plot holes, and there are so many missing parts to the story that when you try to piece it together, you still can't figure it out or you just there like OK so wait what just happened. And we watch this last night before we went to bed, and I forgot to post my review. So ultimately, it's a movie that you would use as sound control when you're cleaning, it's not something I would sit down and watch again. ￼￼","Aug 8, 2023",audience_review

River Wild,Aaron S,"I'm a pretty big fan of outdoor sports themed action thrillers (lol...there's enough of them to be considered a micro genre I think?). This one is undeniably pretty dopey but was also engineered in a lab to keep you chowing down on popcorn. The premise is middling, the acting is average, the motivations are thin, and Adam Brody's face tats and mullet are pretty comical ways to make a sweetie pie into a villain, but if you know what you're getting into with this, it's a perfectly adequate thriller with some gorgeous outdoor visuals and a very clear good vs evil plotline that is fun and easy to digest.","Aug 7, 2023",audience_review

River Wild,Josh R,A much darker take than the 1994 film with Streep and Bacon. It just takes the basic premise of that film but it's a brand new story and characters. Brody and Meester are great leads and the action is handled very well. It clearly doesn't have the budget of the original but it works in the films favor with grittiness.,"Aug 6, 2023",audience_review

River Wild,ione l,"HORRIBLE movie. It's an insult that it has the same title as the Meryl Streep film. I have a question... if a psycopath and your brother are wrestling in the water about 20 feet away from a gun that is lying on the beach, would you 1. go get the gun and end the torment or 2. spend 10 minutes trying to saw through ropes that tie a hostages hands together with a pocket knife. If you are a thinking human being the answer is 1. If you are a lazy writer that wants to make the characters look like absolute idiots and wants to make the audience lose their minds, then 2. This movie continuously has their characters choose the most UNIMAGINABLY stupid options in nearly every scenario. If you value your sanity, DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM! The writers and producers should never be allowed to make another film again. The collective intelligence of the human race, lowers by about 10 points, due to the existence of this movie.","Aug 6, 2023",audience_review
River Wild,Holly J,"I'm always rooting for Adam Brody and Leighton Meester. Both actors have given their fans stellar performances in movies and various series. I thought Adam Brody was convincing as Trevor, the ex-con whose anti-social tendencies become apparent from the get-go-, his performance was unnerving. Leighton Meester was equally convincing as the apprehensive, intuitive, and fearless doctor and sister to Gray, her brother. Taren as Gray was a nice surprise--he can play a serious character. I thought the supporting actors also gave strong performances. The movie never lagged like some thrillers do or ran too long, to the point where the movie loses it momentum and becomes silly. I liked River Wild and would recommend it to friends.","Aug 6, 2023",audience_review

River Wild,Bill S,"One of the worst movies of 2023. Overall poor acting (especially the lead actress), characters making idiotic decisions one after the other, and a villain who can somehow overpower multiple men much larger than him. The best (worst?) part was when the bad guy emptied his clip shooting in one scene (with the gun clicking empty), just to start firing rounds again just seconds later.

I feel it was a great stopping point (minor spoilers ahead) as it rounded out Gwen's character arc. Beyond all of this, the movie felt like it was made for Gen Z, and I'm all here for it.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,jason d,"None of the characters are redeeming. This dark, but artistically well designed film features various spidermen lie, steal, treat their parents with disrespect, and see generally unpleasant towards each other. The movie promotes shows an upper middle class family whose kid is in a private school agree to portray their kid as a victim of society to get into a more local school. Politics are rife, with support for BLM and calls for the destruction of the establishment being subtle undertones that are tossed quietly enough to ensure the audience that the agenda is being pushed without garnering enough attention to be promoted as one if the modern agenda driven films. Nevertheless, it is - though unlike most films driven by agenda, the underlying story is a good one. But for me, I’m tired of politics in movies. I’m tired of the message. And I’m tired of character’s, especially “heroes,” that are just not good people. Yes, they express the “real world,” but I go to the movies to escape and be entertained, not preached to.","Jul 16, 2023",audience_review

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,Bob_Who,"Total Surprise! Beautiful Artwork! Best animation and artwork I've seen on screen in a long time. Very original and tastefully conceived comic book concept and a rich colorful palette. Fantastic musical grove and instrumental score, with panache and brilliant music direction right from the start — (Best drums in film since Birdman (2014). Excellent vocals. Interesting fusion of hip hop, R & B, Soul, and Avant-garde. Imaginative story, developed characters with crisp dialog, cast, acting, and pace. A well-developed screenplay, with nuance and emotional insight. It portrays authentic family dynamics with candor and humor with an entirely enjoyable cast of characters. I was skeptical at the notion of yet another Marvel Comic Book spinoff, particularly backtracking into the land of illustrated artwork animation. How could a cartoon really offer anything more than the preceding full feature film blockbusters? I was wrong. The reviews are correct. This concept and story would have languished in the conventional genre. . The story's quantum complexities of a multiverse and parallel worlds was much better animated than cinematography without imagination. Vivid sights and sounds are a Calliope and jubilee of conceptual art and sound. It is a disservice to the comic book film genres and forged new ground in animation fantasy. The high quality development of the script, and cast, set, an authentic emotional foundation to the vicarious grasp on the viewer, that the ensuing kaleidoscope of color and sound was all the less difficult to suspend our disbelief entirely. That was a very pleasant surprise to me. It takes the quality of Finding Nemo, Shrek, and Toy Story, but connects with an adolescent audience instead of grade school and kindergarten. It has relevance to middle school and junior high kids, as well as their parents, without diving into the backseat of the Chevy for heavy petting. While not shying away from mature emotional themes, it omits the chicanery of high school dereliction, or kids getting in over their heads with sex drugs and rock-n-roll. The development of the parents as characters as well as the young hero and heroine was a very nice touch. Also, this is the first good example of an accurate racial balance in a modern urban landscape. It is an example of New York (or Gotham) at is civil best: where black, white, Hispanic, Puerto Rican, Cubans, Brazilian, Mayan, Canadian, south, north-east, western folks seamlessly combine without any racial injustice or conflict of racial or economic disparity or injustice. Certainly, these are young middle class family's with hardworking parents, or single parents, but it's not contrasted to any plutocracy such as the immense wealth of Batman's Bruce Wayne. This fantastic journey seems to nicely portray the underlying metropolitan landscape with a remarkably optimistic emotional intelligence and harm reduction. Nobody seems badly injured, terrified, or suffering post-traumatic harm from the battle between good and evil. Whether street warfare or domestic family struggles between parents and their teens, there is civility and decorum. Whatever struggles ensue, all behave like adults and refrain from cruelty in the heat of the moment. No obsessive hostilities nor painful regrets and woe for taking power struggles too far and suffering the consequences. There is no permanent damage to our diverse superheroes, to their family relationships, or friendships, nor with themselves in the multiverse. No matter the struggle, they all live to see another day. There is no lasting harm to life, or their relationships and standing in society, No guns or bullets destroying lives for a refreshing change. Today, as the Supreme Court decides to end affirmative action, I find it very reassuring to see that in Spider-man's Spider-Verse that there is no racial or gender inferiority. The virtues of our characters are their intelligence, compassion, honestly, and hard work. They may not be as wealthy as Tony Stark's or Bruce Wayne, but they certainly have an abundance of love in their family life, music and beautiful art all around them, and a very promising shot of a true love. I give this film a solid 9 of 10. I think this new genre of animated surrealism has tremendous potential of leveling the emotional, spiritual, and moral playing field of our mutual reality. Where the imagination, music, graphic art can express style and flair with a broader palette than conventional photo realism. For the first time in years, I find myself interested in cartoon animation once again, as a practical tool in the film experience. I look forward to well written and directed sequels, albeit comic books, for their spectacular audiovisual artistry.","Jun 29, 2023",audience_review

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,Michael F,"Flawless animation and creative presentation of the myriad Spidey variants. Particularly enjoyed the brief Nicholas Hammond clip and the brooding Ben Reilly. Sensory overload of the myriad Spidey variants though, exploring the same territory as the last Dr. Strange and Loki. Head of the task force even inserts himself with an alternate family a la WandaVision. The film needs to be seen on demand or DVD so one can explore the intricate detail that goes by too fast on first viewing.","Jun 24, 2023",audience_review

This is my second watch and I saw more things that I didn’t see the first time and that is what i love about animation. Seeing every little Easter egg, pop up or inside joke be told and understood when you go looking for it or when you get to just be there and experience it yourself. Nothing feels better than understanding all the elements that make what seems like a few seconds on screen have such an impact and consequence on the story down the line . Movie of the year, no doubt.","Jun 23, 2023",audience_review

The animation is ridiculous and was definitely better than the first ( though occasionally there can be too much going on). The movie as a whole is not quite as good as the first, but definitely a worthy follow up. Voice acting performances were great. Music was good. Due to it being a part 1 it naturally takes a lot of time to set up things with no pay off until the next movie. Still I highly recommended.","Jun 22, 2023",audience_review

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,Cj,"Wow what an unexpected treat this movie is! My two teens actually agreed on what to see, which should have filled me in a bit. I wasnt expecting it to be animated nor was I expecting it to be so great! It had some very potent emotional dialogue that actually had my eyes watering a bit due to being able to relate in many points throughout the film. If you are a parent I highly suggest you take your preteens or teens or even adult children & watch it together, Im so happy I did. Youll gain a bit of teen cred & enjoy a pretty amazing & very different Spider-Man movie.","Jun 21, 2023",audience_review

My son has been a fan of the original one since he was 4 and he really liked it although he didn't understand some of the meaning and some of the jokes.

The film was entirely mesmerizing across the board.","Jun 20, 2023",audience_review
Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,Casa,cant wait for #3 so many great moments in this movie. alot of jokes of course as always with spiderman but this feels limitless in potential and the villain in this was great as well. makes me want a live action of this ASAP. one of the best spidey movies ive ever seen my gf isnt even fond of animated movies but loves this series she cant wait for #3 either !,"Jun 20, 2023",audience_review

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,Wally Lord,"This is a miraculous work of art! A wonderful mixture of warmth, suspense, action, spectacular animation and beautiful art work, this is the heart-warming and humorous struggle of teen-aged Miles Morales trying to balance family and Spiderman commitments, and to clarify his values in a confusing world.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,Jill,"It was well done but the story was slow towards the end. When a movie has my attention, I don't think about the time. With at least 20 minutes left, I started asking myself when it was going to be over. If I had known it would end in a cliff hanger, I might not have had a problem. If you like this Marvel character, then you should definitely see it. Just be aware it is a 'to be continued'.","Jun 20, 2023",audience_review

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,DL,"Visuals were even better and more diverse than the previous movie, and the movie gave its characters room to have a satisfying emotion arc (to be paid off in the sequel) without ever feeling slow.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,movie Matt,"Well done! Part of the novelty of the first movie was its unique style and artistic choices layered on top of an excellent story...so when I heard people saying this was just as good if not better, it found it hard to believe. If that is your fear, put it to rest. This has heart, solid character arcs for the heroes we know, and also several new characters that add without distraction. Also the art...the animation was able to to one up the previous film which I wasn't sure was possible. All in all a great film that just happens to be animated.","Jun 19, 2023",audience_review

It is often as loving, caring and lighthearted as the first movie, but there are key moments in which the story matures with its protagonist and takes a darker turn. The animation quality is phenomenal, even surpassing that of the first movie, and the characters continue to be endearing and relatable, especially because of the stellar voice cast who reel you into their hearts and souls. An absolute must-see.","Jun 19, 2023",audience_review

The whole thing could have been at least 45 minutes shorter. There should be a warning for epileptic. The color bursts and quick shot changes were enough to give seizures to anyone.

All the characters are developed truthfully, and it makes them so relatable for audiences of all ages. The action is pretty cool too! I loved The Spot as the villain and Miguel O’Hara as an additional antagonist pushing Miles’ story forward. This is truly Gwen’s story, however, so keep that in mind going into it, if you weren’t prepared for that before. Highly, highly recommend seeing this in theaters!","Jun 18, 2023",audience_review

Also spider pig meet spider cat, I won't spoil it and say when it shows up but let me tell you, it's as funny and adorable as you're probably thinking it is.

Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,Steven,"This movie is amazing. Five years ago, we all thought the ground-breaking animation style that ""Into the Spiderverse"" brought to the screen would never be matched. Across the Spiderverse has not only matched, but surpassed with visuals so awesome. Aside for the thrilling visuals, the writing is top notch. The writers knew exactly how to pull in all these characters to excite fan boys of the comics, but also intrigue those looking for an entertaining show. Sure, those who have not seen the first film are not going to understand some things that are going on, but it would still be an enjoyable film. If you have not seen the first movie, it's worth it to watch before seeing the second movie. I plan to go back and watch the initial movie again within the next week to refresh my memory.","Jun 17, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Kitty M,"I heard from a friend that the book was extremely popular, and we hoped that the movie would equally be as good. Yet, merely a few minutes into watching we realized how aweful this would be. For one, I am unsure if the actors are simply incompetent/inexperienced, or if the actors simply had little to work off of. Both wouldn't be surprising as there were many issues throughout the movie. To begin with, the actor who played Prince Henry had barely any expressions the whole time. He talked about his father dying, but did not seem to be actually sad about it. When he revealed that he actually liked Alex for a while it was completely unbelievable. For some reason the actor was unable to demonstrate in previous scenes the underlying feelings of hidden attraction. Now the actor who played Alex was just as bad but I would say he gets less points from me because he had so many more opportunities in the movie to demonstrate good acting, and failed each time. He didn't truly feel sad or shocked that Prince Henry abandoned him in the middle of the night. Further, his scenes with his mother and Nora were cringy and disappointing as many thought processes of his emotions were conducted during these scenes. Now the writing was absolutely atrocious which may explain for the poor acting. I'm no actor myself, but any little I could possibly do would be completely down trodden by having to act out this script. The sex scenes were too emphasized rather than the development of their emotions. Further the movement from one scene to the next was choppy and sudden, giving no flow to the movie. The scene of the falling cake was particularly bad, as well the insignificant scene of Prince Henry driving his car up to Alex and suddenly he wasn't in his car anymore. I cannot explain how the crew possibly could have ruined a scene of a man getting out of a car... Also, so many things happened that were insignificant and of no use to the plot. For one Nora met Prince Henry's friend and developed a romance with him. But these scenes added nothing for the audience. No awe, hilarity, and seemed to be pointless filler that never even got a finite ending as the audience was given no further information. It certainly could have been edited out and the movie would make just as much sense, and would thankfully have ended sooner. For a movie to be two hours long you would think there would be great character and plot development. Instead we were given a trashy, and americanized view of the royal family that I as a child of English parents feel embarrassed to have seen. Hopefully actual professionals will make a revised version of this movie in the future that is both written and shot better. However, I doubt that will happen as the whole thing is ridiculously unrealistic and idealistic. On one last note I'm so sure the director used the guise of progressiveness to make the movie only about sex and gain viewership through all the smut.","Aug 14, 2023",audience_review

No complaints. Funny and touching. A very good story, as well. My only complaint is that the production quality suffers a bit. I did not care for the intro or the credits at the end. A friend also mentioned that he almost turned it off as he perceived the intro to be that of a B-class movie. Transitions between some scenes were a bit awkward. There were minor technical details. In one scene, Alex says goodbye to Henry and boards a corporate jet. The tail number is registered in Russia (RA0639). I hardly think the HRH Prince Henry or First Son Alex would be anywhere near a Russian-flagged aircraft. A $50 decal could have changed the tail number to either an ""N"" or a ""G."" Similarly, at the end of the movie when they were on bicycles, where were the Secret Service and the UK PPO/SO14? There is no way these two would run the streets on bicycles without a security contingent or two. But all that is picking nits. This was a fun and warm movie. I hope there is a sequel.","Aug 14, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Kathy L,"I watched this movie twice, it's wonderfully written and the two leads are amazing. I haven't read the book but the story is sweet and clever.

Taylor is handsome, fun, and attractive, while Nicholas is a talented actor. His emotions drew me in and I felt a lot of empathy for him and his lonely character. Please make a second movie, or even better, have the original cast do a TV show.","Aug 14, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Tatyana A,"This predictable, heartfelt and sometimes haha rom com is populated with impossibly and stunningly hot 20 somethings with firm bums and washboard abs (the guys anyway). Uma Thurman plays the first female president of the U.S.A. and mom of one of love smitten fellas in question turns out a barely passable Texas accent. Stephen Fry's appearance as the King (and grandpapar to Prince Henry…now there's a roundabout commentary on the royal life of a similarly named spare) adds a glorious touch of restrained humour. Everything here is formulaic, idealistic and so bloody positive…which is fine I suppose…violence in film is kinda ho-hum and pointless and ""film"" is a totally different animal. I found it interesting (or maybe not ‘cause this is an American film) that the American was a top…right?! Anyway…RW&RB is kinda like a gay Hallmark romance flick but with sex and by golly it's about flippin' time. Yay for gay!","Aug 14, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Steve S,"What makes this film so special is that it is a rom-com with two men. It's a traditional fluff film but arrives with heavyweight baggage around it's neck. Firstly it gets an R film rating citing subject matter, brief nudity a d language. No! It's because it's two men. Some people may not approve, so that should make it a pg-13 rating. No frontal nudity, just 2 average looking men kissing. There is no frontal nudity, just a second or two of a buttock. It's a 1950 Doris Day rom com. It's a special film because it IS that ordinary. We need to slowly introduce the courtship of two men to the public. The perception of gay life is far more R rated than the reality. Well done Matthew Lopez. A film with a huge message delivered with subtly.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Marck Albert M,"""We won. We won."" It's just two simple words that should mean winning the election, but somehow gets translated into something more special. We have definitely won with this film. Being a person who has read the book again and again, I had an expectation when they announced that this will have a film adaptation. It did not disappoint. It tackles not only the romance between two men, but also greatly shows how hard it is to be in a gay relationship due to social pressure. As gay people, it is already hard to find someone who will love and accept you for who you are, let alone someone who can be proud of you and will be by your side against the society's unjust treatment. Yet this story shows and teaches you that you can learn to be proud of something the society has taught you to be ashamed of. This film shows you that being courageous takes time. It's okay to be scared. This is a scary world to live in. But as long as you have someone who will love, support, and be proud of you, then you can and will definitely win against anything.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Tabea,"The movie left so many important things out it was honestly unbearable to watch. I love the book with my whole heart it hurts that they changed so much about it and left so many important things out. I would've understood if they changed tiny unimportant things about it but to leave out June, Rafael Luna (who contributed to half the plot which they also left out) and even made Alex' parents still be together even though an important part of his personality comes from them not being together is just so weird to me. It didn't feel like the book at all. Also if I hadn't read the book before the movie would've been even more confusing than it already was. The whole movie just feels like a few scenes stuck together without context. Honestly just weird movie overall. Truly sad that I waited so long for this.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Erika M,An absolutely delightful romantic comedy that had me giggling right from the start! This story was a breath of fresh air after a long drought of anything noteworthy in the romcom genre. I immediately messaged all of my friends to watch it and we haven't stopped talking about it since! The two dynamic and gorgeous leading actors have an insane level of chemistry that will literally electrify you right through the screen. By the end of the movie even the most cynical of hearts will be reduced to nothing but a puddle of melted goo after witnessing such a touching love story.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Naomi K,"Directed by Matthew Lopez and starring Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez, red white, and royal blue told a completely funny story. red white and royal blue is a romance movie about characters who embark on a journey of love. Despite the obstacles, big and small, the characters in the movie, as well as the viewers, still meet a great end. The performances from Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez illustrate the narrative of this movie with such a viable effort. Consequently, this film ended up being as very relaxing to watch as it is. red white and royal blue intertwined visuals, audio, and plot in a very romantic way. It was as if Matthew Lopez combined the characters, the setting, and the valued objects within the film and then threw them into a mixing bowl to create a giant serving of wonderful taste. This story of love is a triumphant effort on Matthew Lopez's part in making viewers weep with joy. Overall, I found red white, and royal blue to be romantic, funny, and very relaxing to watch! It is a great plate of steak, seasoned with the theme of love, and sure to leave you with a lingering sweet taste in your mouth.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Michelle H,"Look most people are rating this movie down because it wasn't a carbon copy of the book, but we have to look at facts. It's a movie with a set run-time and they have to develop the story from the base material to fit within that time and still be good enough to keep an audience. So yes they left out Alex's sister and kept his parents together, but Alex and Henry's story is the center. A lot of people find a good movie and then go to the book after and this should send many people flocking to the book to find the parts they had to trim. The way they shot the love scene alone makes this movie better than anything else. Sure there are good gay movies among a plethora of average or below average ones out there. Free Fall stands out as one of the best ones. RWRB does something special though, it gives you not just a sex scene but a LOVE scene. It didn't cut away or fade to black to remain modest and unproblematic, it gave as good exposure as a hetero sex scene would. But the truly special thing is that it was a love scene and what I mean is you could see the care and trust and love the characters shared, it wasn't primal need and lust or an explosion of feelings leading towards satisfying their need for pleasure. It was Henry giving himself to Alex body, heart and soul. It was realistic in it's vulnerability and still sensual. It sets a bar for male/male love scenes that I hope becomes standard. There is a gaping void that needs to be filled by realistic LGBTQ movies instead of tired tropes that do nothing to help foster good relationships within the community and show the world that we too are deserving of the same love as straight stories.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Chris P,This was a great movie to watch. I enjoyed the performances from everyone not just the leads. It was believable and relatable.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Troy M,"If you're searching for a reason to believe in the magic of love once again, then ""Red, White, and Royal Blue"" (RWARB) is the film to watch! As someone in their mid-40s, I've seen my fair share of love stories. But this one? It has a charm like no other. With a line-up of heartwarming narratives this past week, from Heartstopper to Young Royals and Marry my Dead Body, RWARB was like a serendipitous encounter with an old flame. The kind you reminisce about over a cozy dinner date, just like the ones my husband and I have enjoyed throughout our ten years of married life. The movie captures the tantalizing tango of two young men, dancing from being rivals to soulmates. Having not read the book, I've heard about missing characters and subplots, but nothing felt amiss. The story was whole, vibrant, and teeming with emotion. Take the New Year's Eve dance sequence, for instance. Amidst the sea of partygoers, their connection was palpable. The universe seemed to stand still as they shared that first electric kiss beneath the tree. Every scene had its magic. From the playful ‘Act Normal' episode in the Red Room to the heart-fluttering moments at the polo match. But the museum dance, choreographed to ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" by Perfume Genius, felt like a love letter to every queer individual who dared to dream. A moment so profound, it made me wish that my teenage self had seen such beauty and representation. Admittedly, a few scenes were so intimate that we considered hiding the film from some extended family members. But then, isn't true love about baring it all, vulnerabilities, passions, and everything in between? Having watched it four times over the weekend, my husband and I found ourselves captivated each time. ""Red, White, and Royal Blue"" is not just a film; it's a celebration of love, embracing every shade of emotion. 🌈❤️🎬","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

But it's so nice to see a queer love story treated the same as any other larger budget romantic comedy-complete with the happy ending. I loved the adaptation from the book. Sure there are great things in the books that are missing but it's the nature of condensing hundreds of pages to 2 hours. Though if rumors are true and there is another hour of footage that was cut, I would happily sit through three hours of this love story. The chemistry between the leads Nicholas and Taylor was palpable and some scenes were so intimate it felt borderline voyeuristic to watch.

Almost anything that's unique to queer relationships (not just the romantic ones) was sucked out of this movie, presumably to make it more palatable to a wider market. What we ended up with was a sterilized, poorly edited, and cold film that lacked depth to any character or inter-character relationship throughout the movie. There wasn't an ounce of chemistry between any actor on the screen at any given time if what they were doing can justifiably be called ""acting."" Truly disappointing how much they gutted this fun, witty, and beautiful story and made a sub-par plastic, Disney-Channel-quality waste of time. I can only hope that this is the last of movie adaptations of a queer story that degrades anything and everything queer until it's just like every other hetero romance flick with a lower budget and a dollar store green screen to show for it.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Paul H,"Great premise - it's too bad they didn't really take it seriously. The leads are super charming, but the acting is quite broad and the writing is pure soap opera. The kissing scenes were seemingly written by someone who has only watched porn, and the sudden Act 2 breakup was just forced for drama. With a better script this could have been more subtle and believable. But as a way to introduce Taylor Zakhar Perez to movie goers, it was a success. Hope he finds a good script soon.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Corey,"let's be honest, it was a poorly paced mess that fell flat on its face. yes we need more queer stories. yes we need more queer joy on screen. yes this movie is cute and sweet, but we shouldn't lower the bar for a movie just because it's queer. would've been much better as a tv show (the summer i turned pretty is a perfect example of a prime video title that was adapted from a book into a wildly successful show) 🙃. the 3hr directors cut was probably way better but amazon has it under lock and key for some reason lmao.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",K G,"Honestly amazing. I made an account just to say so. We need more stories like this; queer romance doesn't need to end in tragedy. We need our happy stories, too.

Through the movie I had to pause to process different kind of emotions that made the movie so well made. It has a good pace giving the sentimental and essential moments the importance it needs.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Marc F,"Really an amazing movie with two awesome leads, for me especially the actor who plays prince Henry. A movie full ob beautiful moments.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Tony D,"Entirely predictable but delicious nonetheless! The movie seemed to rush us through the stages of the relationship compared to the book, but it was wonderfully filmed and the actors delivered believable and sincere performances. Haven't yet seen much in print about the character (Zahra) written for Sarah Shahi, but her scenes were some of the funniest. The leads were dreamy and the film made me cry and smile.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Alexandra F,"The book was five stars. The movie was a zero. What a stinker. Really bad. I'm glad young queer kids are into it, but as a cinema fan, I can't believe how many people are raving. The performances were meh. The story was choppy. There was no build up. No real meet-cute. The cake scene was stupid and over played. Literally the best part of the movie was Rachel Maddow's surprise appearance. Uma Thurman should be ashamed of that accent. Casting was off, acting was amateurish, script was a dud. But do read her books. Casey McQuiston is a real talent.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Iya Q,"It's not the pinnacle of film history per se, but if you want something comforting and feel-good and it just so happens to be a romcom, I definitely recommend watching this film. The formula is tried and tested, the tropes are ever so present and you know what? I like it. In a world of uncertainty, I'd like my predictable happy endings once in a while. This definitely goes into my romcom heavy rotation.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Monica U,"The movie was good, we can see the hard work of the whole cast and people behind the scenes. When I first heard the movie was adapted from the book, I thought it was just a title, because now a lot of movies, and series though they mention adapted from the book, it is not the case when you see the movie/series. But in RWRB, 90% of the movie is from the book, as it is only 2 hrs movie, and not all things that happened in the book can cover. Taylor and Nicholas have wonderful chemistry, and watching them together feels so joyful. I really enjoyed watching the movie","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review

Yes, there are some quick comments about erections and ONE suggestive sex scene that doesn't even show a backside but that's about it.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Joseph P,"While the book itself is mildly formulaic, the movie dumbs it down further with an eye-candy laden, attractive but brattish performance by Perez. This is not entirely his fault; both the script and direction leave no room for thought or depth, and the intellect and ambitions of both lead characters in the book is abandoned in favour of cliche. The insertion of a jilted ex, and the now unintelligible/unexplainable final scene without context, are not made up for by Galitzine's pout nor the oddly more masculine Royal confrontation. A pretty film, with pretty leads and some chemistry, but ultimately saying nothing meaningful: fairy-floss, not a substantial romance.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review

I haven't read the book because I'm not a fan of any smut. The film contains a couple smut scenes too, to which I skipped. Plot wise, it feels a bit rushed but the acting makes up for it. Either way, this is a brilliant film and something to watch for comfort.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Thomas M,The book is my favorite and I had high expectations. A lot of characters and subplots were cut out to focus solely on the romance. I'm happy to say the cast was perfect and they left in all the important moments from the book. My only complaint was the story moves so fast but at 2 hours I think they did the best they could (it's a pretty long book!) If you're a fan of the book watch it twice. The first time I was so nervous I couldn't fully enjoy it. The second time I was thoroughly enjoying my time :),"Aug 12, 2023",audience_review

For the first 20 mins to half an hour this movie reminded me of the acting in the ""Nickelodeon"" show ""Big Time Rush"" but as the movie progresses it does get tremendously better.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",lloyd t,"Recognizing the challenge of adapting a full book into a 2 hour movie, this movie was beyond exceptional. The director captured the soul of the story. The actors, Taylor and Nick, lifted Alex and Henry straight from the pages of Casey and brought them into the screen in their full cinematic glory. The supporting cast, especially Uma, Sarah, Rachel and the rest complimented the main actors like a dream. They treated this movie with great intricacy and delicately that what is left is its heart right on its sleeves. A true manifestation of what a rom com feature should be. Will this make history? To those who needs to hear and see a story like this, Yes.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

I like the chemistry between Alex and Henry, especially the lake scene, their acting is so natural, it just seems like two men are totally falling in love with each other. The love and braveness they have towards their relationship is so touching. And the sex scene is just SO ROMANTIC !!! Not just juicy but you can feel how gentle they present this scene, I am crying for the movie is just two hours long.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Sarah M,"The movie isn't terrible, but when I heard they were making this movie I was so excited and I was terribly let down. I'm always a person that understands that you can't adapt a book word for word. However, there were so many things in this movie that were changed and I just didn't get why. And then there was June... or rather wasn't.. Why? However, I could have ignored all of this and enjoyed the movie if Alex and Henry were executed well. But they weren't. The actors we're great, don't get me wrong, but their personalities were so different. I was two minutes in and was like Alex would NEVER say/admit something like this in that situation. And Henry just wasn't Henry anymore at all. I love this book so much. It's one of my absolute comfort reads, but that movie just wasn't it. I missed the personal connection between the two, it felt rushed.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

My only wish is that it was a little longer… so many moments felt a little rushed and you could sort of feel the corporate execs hovering over the film saying ""Keep it under 2 hours.""

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Robin J,"I read the book at a difficult time in my life when I was coming to terms with being queer, and I fell in love with it immediately. The kind of representation that the book holds is incredible, and this feeling thoroughly translates through to the film. It was heartwarming, tearjerking and beautifully acted. All of the cast were brilliant, but especially Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez who portrayed Henry and Alex incredibly and to perfection, their chemistry was amazing and it was really like the characters in the book had come to life before me. Of course as it's a movie version of a book not all the scenes can be included, but I found that the joy, heartbreak and overall message of love and acceptance really shone through. As a gay teenager, this kind of film is extremely important and shows that LGBTQ+ people deserve the epic love stories that are often only shown for straight couples on screen. To quote from the book, this film encourages queer viewers to ""take anything you want and know you deserve to have it."" This is a movie that has a special place in my heart and I know I will watch it time and time again.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Ellie,"Honestly I loved this movie. I recently reread the book to refresh my memory and I understand why some people are mad as there is a lot of scenes, characters and background cut but the book takes place over the course of a couple of months to a year and they did a really good job at fitting it all in only 2 hours, though that being said the movie is very fast and there isn't any background on A lot of the scenes like how they end up in Paris ec but again I think they did get a great message across in such a sort time. I liked the new scenes they added so the movie wasn't completely predictable but it still feels like the book. I am disappointed in the characters that were cut like June and how Bea, Pez and nora gets a lot less scenes but I understand the movie is focused on Henry and Alex so I can excuse that . I think the actors and actresses did excellent jobs especially Nicholas Galitzine I think his acting was really good especially in the highly emotional scenes. I would have preferred it being a series to really show case the book as a hole but again with the time they had they did a great job I thought it was funny and a great romance that I will be watching again. I have to say Zahra was definitely one of my favourite characters and she really felt the most like her book character. All being said I would definitely recommend the movie and don't listen to the haters","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

Não é cansativo em nenhum momento e os fãs não terão tempo de respirar, porque é emoção atrás de emoção. A história de amor entre Henry e Alex vai emocionar os fãs e também quem não conhecia a história. Um filme necessário sobre insegurança, respeito e descobertas. Vale a pena ser assistido!

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Fran W,"A spicy, almost-iconically queer love story that's sure to get your heart racing, make you blush, and leave you wondering just how much carbon our real-world royals and politicians are contributing to the climate crisis. Following the typical anxiety-ridden, skip-quickly-through-character-development, and bad-at-communicating-with-your-lover plot points of other rom-coms, a prince and president's son find themselves in a hot, secret affair that beckons you to watch and want more. In a stroke of genius, the movie creators have mustered real-world social media clout for these fictitious instagram lovers leading up to the film's release. If there was a critique to be had on this point, it would be that there are simply not enough shirtless photos of both men on Instagram. While some are craving a sequel, I desire nothing more than a 5-season show.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

The intimate scene was soooo beautiful, the most beautiful I've seen in a while, you could see the love and the passion and how much they cared for each other.

Overall, both the main actors acted their part really well. Definitely felt the connection.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Jade B,"My take I really enjoyed the movie. My expectations were definitely very high, but I did try to prepare myself and remember that movie adaptations are rarely as good as the book. It would be hard to fit that much of a story into two hours. As many have said, I did feel it was a bit rushed. I feel like had there been an extra 20-30 minutes, some of the stories could have been a little more complete/fleshed out. However, I am really just excited to have the movie and to see Taylor and Nick bring the characters we love so much to life. It wasn't perfect, but I love the movie because I love the book and because I love Alex and Henry.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Camilla L,"If you have read and loved the book, you will absolutely ADORE the movie. And if you're new to Alex and Henry's story, well, welcome on board! This movie is awesome, it's a witty, fun and swoony rom-com that deals with matters of identity, inclusion, privilege, what it means to find yourself and the hardships that come with it; and, most importantly, it's about love, a real and powerful love between two people that challenge themselves and their lives to stay together. And it's proof that love, true love, knows no barriers - no matter who you are, where you come from, or how you identify yourself as. The leads have done an incredible job, they're perfectly cast and their chemistry is INSANE; their story is portrayed beatifully, in a clever and fun way that engages the audience and also gives some elements to think about. 10/10, 5 full stars, A++","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Nayana J,Modern fairytale romance. A bit predictable and formulaic but it's also very cute and sweet.

For friends of the book, anything that they can't cover in detail tries to mention, and for people who are watching the film without having read the book first, it's just a good movie; it will make you laugh.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Alice F,"An amazing and soulful performance from Nicholas Galitzine (Henry) who was able to showcase the prison that was Henry's world and mind simply with his eyes and body language. If Alex, with his positive and strong personality, would be described as the heart of the movie, than Henry is most certainly it's soul. The movie felt a little bit fast paced and would perhaps have fitted better as a one season series, but it essentially captured the heart of the story. Loved it.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Chad E,"I understand book to movie adaptations have to cut some things, but what was cut is what made the book so good! This movie was straight-washed. The angst of Alex figuring out his sexuality, gone. The turkey scene, botched. Karaoke night, did they even read that part of the book?? Just really missed the whole point of the book. Honestly feels like they just decided we'll make a straight rom com but the main characters will be dudes and we'll call it representation.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Jepoy O,As a book avid fan and I read and hear the Book/Audiobook for many times that I can't count it anymore. They should done this as a TV Series. The characters build up are not there and it is lacking. There are a lots of scenes in the book that should be in the movie (They tried to fit too much from the book in a couple of hours which usually the issue with book to movie adaptation). However the two lead actors are so gorgeous and hot (they done there part so good and it gives justice to the book at least) and I disagree for those people who says that they don't have chemistry. However I still grateful and appreciative to the team who created this movie and make the book came into life. 👏 Still 3.5 out of 5 for this movie.,"Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Lena J,"I loved the movie very much, entire focus is on Alex and Henry and their relationship.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Stefano S,"The book, amazing, this adaptation not so much. It was a complete miss for me. This miss included but isn't limited to the list of June and Senator Luna, the rushed unbelievable gay romance, Uma Thurman as a Texan, Taylor Z Perez had no chemistry with any of his cast mates, the loss of divorce representation, and the complete disregard to character Henry's character development. They (who ever approved this for airing) took a thanksgiving dinner and gave us a dollar store ham sandwich. They had an opportunity to deliver a beautiful queer love story and choose to make a gay movie for straight people. Recast and make it the mini series that we all deserved.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Rmulo V,"O filme começa de um jeito bem rápido, fluído, o relacionamento de Alex e Henry já começa a se desenvolver rapidamente de uma forma satisfatória, sem enrolação.

It's a perfectly balanced rom-com, with funny scenes, very cute scenes, but also emotional and dramatic scenes, and all of them make sense. The storyline shows both of their points of views, which makes us, viewers, understand the two sides of the story. Nicholas and Taylor's performances are amazing and I am sure they are proving many people wrong! Their chemistry is actually insane, the way they look at each other is so beautiful, and it's so easy to understand what they're feeling during the movie.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Gaia S,A little bit toned down in comparison to the novel ( which is more erotic ) and unfortunatelly some of the side characters were rationalyzed away or got shorter screen time ... so that the almost 2-hour movie has more time to focus on the main couple instead.

I went into it slightly skeptical keeping in mind the alterations to the plot but this is a pretty solid adaptation and a very good stand-alone Hallmark film as well. The core essence of the book was retained, Alex and Henry are very charming. I was doubtful about how they would condense a 500 page novel into a movie and not a series, the film was surprisingly very well done.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",mary p,"The book Red White and Royal Blue was written as a way to forget about the world since 2016 and see an alternative universe. After seeing this movie I know which one I'd rather live in. I loved the book and was skeptical at first when I read about the changes (leaving out a couple of key characters for example) but if anything there wasn't enough room for the side characters who were left. This is very much Henry and Alex's story. Taylor Zahar-Perez and Nicholas Galitzine are perfect in their parts as Alex, the first son and Henry, prince of Wales. Their chemistry and struggles to form a maintain a romantic relationship given their roles and responsibilities is explored very well and is painful and joyful in parts. Taylor in particular shows Alex as incredibly vulnerable despite his outward cockiness. He is also funny and very intelligent, not wanting to be seen as just a playboy. Nicholas as Henry is highly believable as a royal. His awkwardness and difficulty opening up and relaxing given his upbringing is shown through every expression and his posture. Sarah Shahi was brilliant as Zahra, so funny. Rachel Hilston as Nora sparkled whenever she was on screen and I'd like to have seen more of that character. Some characters were a little simplified. Miguel, Prince Philip, Beatrice and Percy were all used sparingly and were one-dimensional. No doubt RWRB will be attacked by the anti woke brigade. The LGBTQIA messaging is even stronger I. The move than it was in the book, as is the idealism of Uma Thurman's presidential ideals, striving for a more equal society. It's good to see this on screen and the representation. The issues faced are still real - Royal tradition and opinion polling points getting in the way of people's relationships. Overall I loved this movie. It's feel good, funny, romantic and all the main characters are engaging and well acted.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Patrick Oliveira C,"Os atores não conseguem convencer 100% que estão apaixonados e isso não é culpa deles e sim dos roteiristas. Cenas importantes foram cortadas, o desenvolvimento adequado que há no livro e que nos passa a real sensação que um nasceu para completar o outro, não é mostrado, é tudo muito raso, o filme se passa rápido demais (apesar das quase 2 horas), portanto não é suficiente para que uma construção ""enemies to lovers"" seja absorvida, você percebe que está raso, e apesar de todas as juras de amor, você sente que aquilo não é tão real, tão intenso como o livro retrata com maestria. 2 horas de filme não é pouco, mas para retratar um livro com mais de 350 páginas, com tantos detalhes, personagens, arcos como o próprio relacionamento de Alex e Henry e a corrida presidencial da mãe de Alex, essas horas são insignificantes, devo dizer que nem 3 horas seriam suficientes para emergir o telespectador de maneira fiel a está história. Entretanto, recomendo, não é a pior coisa criada para as telas, é bom de se ver e se você for sentimental pode até se emocionar.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

This movie was better than I expected, made me want to read the book. Forbidden love, long distance, politics and traditions, angst, misunderstandings, tokens of affection, and this movie has even more. The R rating seems strict, I think there was only one naked butt shown, and the suggestive sex scene was tame compared to PG13 hetero scenes in other films. And I don't think the F-word was ever used, although other expletives were. Oh, the male leads had good chemistry. The comedy aspects were my favorite bits though, specifically Zahra's scenes and the Secret Service lady's scenes. Recommend it! 9/10.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Joseph M,"A beautiful, although greatly sanitized film version of the novel, that never plainly states that bigotry and homophobia are the principal obstacles standing in the way of these two men living out, proud and happy. Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez bring the novel's Henry and Alex to life beautifully. Perez seems at times to be channeling Cary Grant in ""Bringing Up Baby."" He is immensely lovable. Galitzine shines in the trickier role of a deeply wounded young man still coping with the loss of his father, who believes he must live his life in the closet - because duty to country is more important than personal fulfillment. His ""Prince Henry"" will stay with me forever. I do wonder how comedic geniuses like Lucille Ball and Buster Keaton would have staged the wedding cake crashing on top of Henry and Alex. That was the one scene I was joyfully anticipating and was underwhelmed by. Strong supporting cast led by Uma Thurman, the United States sexiest president to date. 🇺🇸 🇬🇧 🇺🇸 🇬🇧","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",rebecca c,"I was so excited for the book to be brought to the screen and had such high hopes after seeing positive reviews prior to the release. However, from the very first minute I could tell that it would be a disappointment. The entire movie felt so rushed and choppy. There was barely any character development or build up due to the terrible decision to completely remove chunks of scenes from the books and character dynamics. Most of the pivotal scenes that were actually included fell flat due to the pacing and editing. The plot and timeline changes made no sense and just made the story harder to follow. I have no problem with and honestly loves a good cheesy, ""hallmark-type"" movie but this was a very hard watch. If you're a fan of the book and want something that lives up to how you've imagined it while reading and does it justice, I highly recommend just not watching this movie. It will just leave you frustrated. Don't let the positive reviews trick you into thinking otherwise.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

When the announcement for the movie came out, I was hesitant about Taylor playing Alex, but after watching the movie, I think both actors played their characters well. Although they strayed a bit from the book, which is expected, I think they did a good job of carrying the spirit of their relationship. I wasn't sure if they'd keep the racy parts until I saw the R rating. I'm usually not a huge fan of sex scenes, but the one they used was essential to the story of Alex & Henry. If you read the book, I think you'll like it a lot. If you haven't read the book, but you like rom-coms, you'll like it. If you're snooty about movies, you'll hate it.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Tadd W,"An attempt at representation for LGBTQIA+ with a typical streaming movie romance that, completely missed the mark from the book. Key notes missed or jumbled in without context to understand. The performance from every cast member done at their best, but lacked more than 65% of the source material aside from the handsome prince, the first female president, and the sharp tongued son.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Raven B,"**SPOILERS** This occasionally quite funny but imperfect adaptation of Casey McQuiston's 2019 novel is comfort fare but sheds some of the source material's more brilliant bits for brevity and narrative simplicity. The son of America's first female president, Alex Claremont-Diaz, is longtime rivals with a one Prince Henry of England until an embarrassing public incident involving a wedding cake forces the two of them to play friends for the cameras to mitigate the fallout. Their fake friendship eventually becomes more than either of them could ever have imagined. The premise seems like the perfect setup for an earnest cheesy romcom. Unfortunately the film falls flat in the build up, and the adaptation's stakes lack the narrative tension present throughout McQuiston's novel. The movie's two hour length feels at once too short to fit all the necessary plot points, as evidenced by some major cuts (Several key characters are removed or rewritten completely, leaving Alex and Henry with far less background to make their characters' stories really feel alive and lived-in, an especial disservice to Nora, Percy, and Henry's beloved Sister Bea who are whittled down to little more than standees with a few quippy one-liners, and supportive bon-mots. The conflict with the Richards campaign is gutted to the point of nonexistence, and perhaps the most egregious omission, the contents of the emails which we are treated to in the novel are utterly excised.) and on the other side of these questionable omissions, we are left with a screenplay that feels empty--contorted and straining to fill its runtime. Some fans of the novel, myself included, may find the missing or repurposed portions of the story lacking, which is a shame, because all I wanted when the film was announced, was to see Tyler Zakhar-Perez's tear-stained face when he found the note from Henry in his pocket that read ""Dear Thisbe, I wish there weren't a wall."". Henry and Alex's correspondence is our biggest window into the lovers' inner worlds and the only time we see Henry's true self laid bare. The film tells us Henry wants to be a writer--but then it is never mentioned again--his love of books--of stories--is in a way the catalyst and the soul of their romance. Alex and Henry both suffer as characters for the loss of some of the novel's most touching moments and Henry especially feels underutilized--the idea of a prince in all its tropey angst rather than the genuine portrait of such a person. The leads acted commendably given the sometimes wooden dialogue the pared down script afforded them. For those who haven't read McQuiston's novel, take heart--I recommend watching the movie first. Its fun and mostly lighthearted tale will make for a feel-good movie night watch. Uma Thurman, Sarah Shahi's, and Rachel Hilson too give great and memorable performances with what they're given. Afterward, pick up the novel and discover what made this story worthy of an adaptation in the first place. ""But the first time I saw you. Rio. I took that down to the gardens. I pressed it into the leaves of a silver maple and recited it to the Waterloo Vase. It didn't fit in any rooms.""","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",chika,"So, I read Red White and Royal Blue in November, and I would arguably say its better than the movie, but that argument could be made for a lot of adaptations. The book had a few slightly cheesy/cringy liners that felt a little too tryhard and on the nose, but I held the same expectations for the movie. For the movie, it was a little more difficult of a watch. They seemed to double down on all that more so especially within the first hour as far as the tacky delivery and corny enactments of the book. Again, I did know what to expect, it's just easier to tune out with your own imagination as opposed to a movie. Being as genuine as possible, I found myself wincing a little more than I wanted to be. Particularly Alex's character is always so forced with sarcasm, and their lines are always delivered with a middle-school writing style that takes you out of the movie and reminds you you're watching people act. The most unbearable scene (SPOILER) was Zahra finding Henry in Alex's closet, I couldn't take watching the forced eye twitches, shakes, and shivers that literally no person would respond with, but anyhow. The corniness came in waves, leaving you unsure if you could rest for a second and enjoy it or if you needed to prepare to erase the scene from your head. All my criticisms aside, this has always been the theme of the movie/book and is why I think it's similar to one of those shows or movies like Heartstopper or Love Simon, which are targeted to younger queer audiences. There were some scenes that did take me back in and remind me of the parts I really enjoyed in the book, especially (SPOILER) Alex coming out to his Mom. Overall, I'd give it about a (5.8) out of 10 for me, but I was still glad I waited for it and watched.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Becca F,"I made this account because of my level of disappointment in this movie. I had such high hopes, and I had been anticipating this movie for over a year, so when I sit down and watch it, only to get a sped over, watered down shell of the original story version of events with most of the time zero context, and key characters to the plot missing, I was disappointed. I feel like the only way you would have a lick of an idea what is actually happening is if you read the book, but if you didn't, have fun trying to find out the background info on the characters, and what happened between all of those months that the movie skipped over, all of the heart to hearts, and what we missed out on when they cut June (Alex's sister) and Henry's mother from the movie. In particular, I was sad they turned the happiest, most smile inducing scene into a 1.5 minute long one with half of it being slow motion silence. Yes, I'm talking about the karaoke bar. This movie is missing so much of the chaotic hilarity in the book, and if you walked into this as a fan of the book, you also probably finished it disappointed. Time to read the book again to fix it in my heart. Def would have been better off as a series so it wouldn't have had to have been shoved into nearly 2 hours.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",arlo,"So, after waiting so long for this movie, I FINALLY have it! Now, some will say that the actors have no chemistry, some will say that the acting is horrible, and some will say that the movie has no meaning unlike the book. However, in my humble opinion, this movie was all I wanted and more. Yes, while It did stray away a little from the book (ESPECIALLY with June being excluded from the film, and sadly the cornetto scene isn't in it :(), It was still very well made, and I will go to war just to be able to say that. I don't know what people were expecting out of this film.. I think some wanted it to be some kind of deep, serious analysis, but lets be honest, that's not what it's supposed to be. Yes, while the book has it's sad and serious moments, the movie has those too. It may not show it in great detail like the book did, but all of the actors, especially Taylor and Nicholas did an amazing job at portraying raw emotion. I think that some people, mostly older women (which is .. weird..) want this movie to basically fetishize a romance between two men, it reminds me of when people say that rwrb is ""too slow"". When people say things like this, it comes off like they don't care about the actual romance, yet just the sexual counterparts. Now, do I think this was the most amazing film in the world? Definitely not. Do I think that this movie can be improved? Yes. But regardless, this movie is still amazing, and I think that it definitely did what it needed to do. Many people, Including myself, have waited years for this movie, and I think most of us are grateful for what we got. If you have read the book, or plan on reading it, I definitely recommend watching this movie. It is sweet, humorous, emotional, and yes, It does have It's steamy moments! (Which, may I add, the sex scenes were FABULOUS! It felt so intimate, It felt like I was intruding on a private moment. Whoever said that Taylor and Nicholas didn't have chemistry, please don't lie, It's a waste of time!)","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Noah E,"Absolutely loved this movie! There were some changes from the book, that are missed, but I do not think the changes detract from the overall story. The message from the novel shines through. The chemistry between the two leads is outstanding and the supporting cast deliver as well. It is a bit rushed, since there is so much to cram into its 2-hour run time, but it works. The movie gives an idealized view of the world that is much-needed escapism from our current reality. Highly highly recommend, and read the book while you're at it!","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Anisha C,"What a absolute please it was to watch this. Nick and Taylor's chemistry was off the charts and the supporting characters, especially uma thurman and sarah shahi absolutely blew me away.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Eduardo D,"The movie felt a little rushed in some parts, mainly in the beginning. Maybe it would work best as a miniseries.

If I didn't read a book my rating would be a bit lower cause we got only a few scenes of them actually knowing and spending time with each others.Emails and messages were short and only a few of them made it into a movie. The chemistry between Taylor and Nicholas was great tho,they really knew their characters behaviours and Alex&Henry love scenes were done with subtleness and just love.

What I got was a mediocre Hallmark movie that is missing the magic of the well written and popular novel. This could have been the YA movie of the year, and instead it has been stripped back to a shell of the original story. Key characters are missing and if you haven't read the book, then the story and timeline will make little sense. When will producers and directors learn that the script and feel of a movie was already written, they just have to bring it to life.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

The chemistry does not work and seems like awkward heterosexual men playing chicken rather than two longing lovers and a lot of the British royalty facts were extremely fictitious. Some of it is funny, a good background watch when you are doing chores but there are other LGBTQ+ shows and movies out there that are miles ahead of this film.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Kat E,"I read Red White and Royal Blue several times and it is one of my favorite stories. The movie had to skim through a bit otherwise it would have ended being twice as long. Prince Henry was played to perfection. His feelings of obligation weigh so heavily on his soul. Alex the son of the first female American President was outgoing, brash and brilliant. I loved the chemistry between the two. The story was touching and sprinkled with humor. While their feelings of mutual distaste did quickly morph to a romance they had to pack alot of the story into only 2 hours. Enjoy this movie, it did the book justice. If you haven't read Ms. McQuiston's book do yourself a favor and read it now. The movie will mean so much more.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Mary W,"I am just filled with unbridled queer joy after watching this movie! Is this a cheesy rom-com? Yes, absolutely.

I know everyone is going to complain about what book scenes got cut from the movie, and of course there are scenes I would have liked to see, but I want to also acknowledge all the new scenes and lines. I actually liked that they added new stuff because it made it a more enjoyable watch for someone who has read the book multiple times and is just thirsty for more great Alex and Henry moments and Zahra quips. This is a movie that we desperately need. Not some cinematic masterpiece, but a silly yet still beautiful and wonderfully comforting movie. Red, White and Royal Blue (the movie) is absolutely going on my comfort watch list (just like the book is on my comfort read list!) Also, if you haven't read the book, what are you doing?

The more intimate scenes wasn't just a sex scene, it was tasteful, there was a lot of meaning and depth behind it, emphasizing and showcasing to the audience the emotional connection of the relationship that the two had developed.

The movie was cute, and I liked the actors, even though they aren't how I pictured the characters, however, I couldn't help noticing that they cut SO MANY of the best characters/scenes of the book in order to fit it into a 2-hour timeframe. I also feel that if I hadn't previously read the book, I wouldn't have understood most of the scenes in the movie, nor would I have cared at all about most of the side characters, as the scenes moved so fast that there wasn't a real storyline and the side characters were not developed at all in the film.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Jeremy J,"It has been a VERY long time since I have even remotely come close to loving a movie adaptation of a book. This. Was SO beautifully done in my opinion. Taylor and Nicholas knocked it RIGHT out of the park; they were absolutely perfect together and definitely meant to BE Alex and Henry. The music was greatly picked, Uma Thurman and Sarah Shahi were wonderful to watch (absolutely nailed their parts as well), and the story was honestly just as beautiful as the book. I loved how creative the emails and texting were back and forth, with the REALLY cool transitions and fade ins as if Henry and Alex were in the same room. That was incredibly creative and gave the story even further emotion. Their first time in Paris gave me chills. The amount of sensual, tender, sweet, and sexual was OHMYGOD worthy. It gave you a LOT of emotions all rolled seamlessly into one moment. Don't even get me started on the V&A scene ; did I cry? Maybe... All in all I am EXTREMELY pleased with how this was done. From the images in my head reading the book to how it was put on screen, it was honestly as if they pulled it right from the book itself and the imagery you had while reading. I really couldn't picture this having gone any other way with any other cast members. I am going to bed a VERY happy fanboy tonight. Well done to everyone and to Casey.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Musata C,Don't think I've ever cried so much at two people being in love.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Erin F,"I'm going to repeat a lot of what others are saying, but I'll say it too. This movie was very good for what it had the time to do. It's obvious that a perfect book adaptation isn't really possible for a single movie, and in order to make it flow, there has to be some changes. Due to wanting as many iconic scenes from the story in the movie, my only real critique is that a lot of the scenes post the New Year's party felt rushed through in an effort to retain some of the scenes that are loved by fans, but I feel that this is excusable. Matthew Lopez has shown in many interviews and statements that he really cared about making this movie one that fans of the book loved, and left the same impact that the book had on people. It really isn't fair, to me, to try to hold a two hour movie to the standard and detail of a full novel, and Lopez did a good job at bringing the scenes that were important to the fans and the general story to the forefront. Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez did a phenomenal job. In the statements that we've been able to get and interviews from before the strike, both of them (namely Taylor from what I've seen) really wanted to do their best to represent this story, and understood its significance to fans and to queer watchers. They fit into the story with good chemistry and really shine in their roles portraying two queer men in the political world and what that means. I also appreciate that it isn't a coming out story. The scene where Alex comes out to his mother is the longest scene about it in the movie, and it's only around 3 minutes long, and any other mention of sexuality is in passing and quickly established. That's not the focus for these characters. It's two publicly political figures trying to figure out their relationship and what to do with it while struggling through the pressures that come with being a public figure. This didn't need to be a coming out story. This is a romance that just so happens to star two men, and I love that this is a movie that displays that as naturally as any other romance film. All in all, Red, White, and Royal Blue is a romance story that does exactly what it needs to, and has the passion and hard work of all involved that make it a good movie to watch. As with any book to movie adaptation, I feel that going in knowing that it will not be a perfect adaption of the novel is important, and holding to the main story line and what the story wanted to tell is the most important thing. I will definitely be giving it a re-watch several times, and am very thankful to Casey, Matthew, Taylor, Nicholas, and all of the others who worked on the adaptation for providing a romance that is fun, emotional, and a hope for the future of film stories that include queer people as the protagonists.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",donna b,"A film filled with love , connection and heat. A new staple in the list of LGBTQ+ must watch films. The two leading actors Taylor Zakhar Perez and Nicholas Galitzine beautifully depict a growing and intense love with their characters Alex and Henry.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",leandro m,"Um filme lindo, cheio de emoção, a comedia e o drama está em seu ponto. Grande direção de Matthew Lopez trazendo a obra literária de Casey Mcquiston para a vida.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Mylene M,"So incredibly witty, very much swot, and so inspiring! I love that there is Alex and Henry against the world, because they are true to themselves no matter what, no matter wherever they were going through, with families, cultural differences and world watching over them, but they didn't let it get to them. They did it in the end! The best movie ever! Thank you so much for making it happen so truly! <3 <3","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Claire E,"Streamlined, cliche (as all good romcoms are) and very quickly paced, this is a fun movie I can definitely see myself rewatching. I was a little wary at first, but the last half really pulled it together. Some performances faltered in sections, but in other places were great! I would have loved much more time with the characters, which is in and of itself a good sign. It did feel a little too shallow. While it would have worked better as a mini-series, I'm not mad about this adaptation. It did what it had to do and I had a good time with it. But I always have to return to the age-old platitude: The book was better.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Dennis W,"I don't understand the ""R"" rating. This was as sweet and innocent as it could be. Almost irritating how sweet it was. The nostalgia for those who love the book was definitely enough to make one giggle cheerfully seeing some scenes from the book come to life. However, this ""adaptation"" proves not how far we have come, but how far we have to go. The film in some ways tries to hide the fact that there is any prejudice at all when it comes to LGBTQ people in the world. There was absolutely none of it. Which is fine, if it doesn't make the viewer question its absence. It was almost a futuristic representation of a culture we have yet to see. Visually, the film was definitely a pleasurable experience. But what it gained in picture it lacked in character development. The film tried to include so much of the book, that it took away from how each of these characters developed throughout time. The backstory on these characters was greatly missed. The scenes in the book that ""made"" the story relatable were missing from the film. If I didn't know from the book how their love developed, I would have been confused as to how they fell in love based on this film. With all of this said… fans of the book are easily able to follow the plot, and love the movie. One would venture to say, reading the book may not make you care about seeing the movie, but seeing the movie will make you want to read the book.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Thilini P,This movie is a beautiful heartfelt romcom between two men who harboured a feud for a long time and were brought together by circumstance and were then forced to navigate their relationship which became an international incident affecting both counties. While they were spending time together they realised they were solely misunderstood by the other and that they were quite alike in many ways than not. It's informative to see when they show the two sides to queer acceptance for younger audience and their families in my opinion. And I also like how they made prince Henry a bit more strong and independent at the end. He was very firm on coming out of his comfort zone and fighting for their love which was a beautiful thing to see. And we all need an Alex in our lives who wouldn't give up on us… I throughly enjoyed this movie.. it's such a sweet movie that is so timely as it so happens.,"Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

The wonderful cast did a great job with the script and the most important scenes were not only included, but spectacularly done.

No. It's an incredible piece of work, which solidifies the fact that queer films or tv don't have to end in tragedy. I imagine I'll be watching this film for years to come with my family, my friends and anyone else I coerce into watching it.

Taylor Zakhar Perez as Alex and Nicholas Galitzine as Prince Henry are addicting to watch and their chemistry is over the roof (kudos to the casting team). As a fan of the novel, I could tell Taylor, Nicholas and the rest of the cast had an immense respect to the original source material. RWRB is a much needed movie that emphasizes the importance of all the letters of the LGBTQIA+ community and I love how they brought up the fact that B is not silent (a spectacular scene between Uma Thurman and Taylor Zakhar Perez). I am confident that this amazing movie will be talked about in the years to come and I know I will be watching and rewatching it again and again.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Kieron F,"This movie is plainly written for the perspective of straight women who want to project their own caricature of what being a gay/bi man is like over any attempt to portray queer men as actual, fully dimensional people. While I don't expect a rom-com to be politically salient, for a movie that relies so heavily on the Anglo-American relationship, it ends up moving from reasonable rom-com artistic license of this relationship to outright lunacy. I'd beg the director to watch a season of The Crown for some very basic notes on a vaguely sensical fictionalised UK-USA relationship. This movie had a promising premise that could have made for a really fun movie but a plot reminiscent of a bad fanfiction leaves Red, White and Royal Blue both a poor example of the rom-com genre and a truly atrocious piece of LGBTQ+ representation, regardless of the talent of the actors involved.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

Also I think it would have been better to pick actors that would seem more comfortable in the roles because they were two straight males.

Alex (Taylor Zakhar Perez) and Henry’s (Nicholas Galitzine) story was beautiful and their characterizations were incredible, and the chemistry not only between Alex and Henry but throughout all of the cast was such a beautiful thing to witness. The depiction of Henry’s character and story was something I was so worried about how it would be adapted to screen, and how they portrayed it on screen was so beautiful; it is by far my biggest praise about the film.

Heart of Stone,Inspire U,"starts alright then loses pace quickly. minor surprises keep you interested such as when they are finally relaxed and get interrupted once again by a great kitchen sequence. Basically ends up being women Vs men. while the only man on her team literally set a virtual path to guide her throughout the mission. not bad for a wannabe mission-impossible Netflix special. it is seen as if 007 car scenes were swapped from an astin martin to a black van and also the female role gets the mayor spotlight distinguishing it from other action movies. It is fun to watch the choreographed action scenes so I would say it passes the time even if it does not quite achieve the rich level of what a movie like SALT, Lucy, or the Tourist would provide. now that I would think about it the yellow journalism themes make it look like LUCY meets Marvel's Black Widow. Rachel Stone could easily be a Marvel story better than what we have seen with recent comic book characters.","Aug 14, 2023",audience_review

Heart of Stone,NJMANGA,The movie started off great the premise of the story was good and could of went so far if they didn't do so much to mess up the story. It's an ensemble cast but than for some reason I felt the director was focusing less on gal galdot but more on the unknown actors in the film specifically the villains than anyone you start enjoying the director and script writer felt ok thats enough of that. Towards the middle the movie did even know what genre it was in anymore and at that point so many charactors were coming in and out I felt confused about the whole story in general. They should of focused on the main premise they presented in the start and kept the same charactors throughout. This movie had so much potential and the writers and director destroyed it,"Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,K H,"So, so, so bad. Would happily have watched Gal Gadot in her version of ""Extraction"" but, unfortunately, this isn't it. Some of the action is ok but everything else in between is super-cringey. The plot device revolves around an advanced AI that can oversee humanity, even predict the future... so maybe the point is that this movie was also written by an AI? Because it doesn't have a single original idea, and really feels like it could be an algorithm that's copy/pasting pieces from every action or spy movie it could access...","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

Heart of Stone,Virginie B,"I don't know where to start... Does an AI write the scenario? It is so easy, and lazy. It seems the dialogue of the film comes from a fortune cookie. The acting is really, really bad, like the mean guy is really mean and forces his face to be mean. For sure, we already know the end; no surprise. The move doesn't really fit Gal Gadot. But well, if you don't know what to do on a Sunday afternoon and need a background for your chores, it is perfect. You can watch it from time to time, you won't be lost.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,Anthony F,"Lazy writing. Lazy story. Lazy acting. Lazy dialogue. Too much ""whatar you doin?"" Gadot is great in her own way, but she is simply not cut out for the spy stuff.

Heart of Stone,Kshitij S,"This movie is what happens when a corporate non-creative executive wants to produce an action project without much conviction. A damp plot being powered by high-budgets result in a total waste of all the A-List stars and their talents. The script is so generic that I won't be surprised if ChatGPT had written it. Gal Gadot is a generic girlboss who looks cool doing action, but has no character depth. The writers tried to give Jamie Dornan's character a complex backstory but like every other aspect of this movie, fail miserably in achieving anything of value. Alia Bhatt is the latest in a long list of Indian movie stars being criminally underutilized in the Hollywood projects and being more a part of the promotional campaigns to attract the South Asian viewers, than the story line. Sophie Okonedo and Jing Lusi are the only two actors who actually deliver some impactful performances in a sea of meaningless fluff. The one and a half star goes for the camera, stunt, and rigging crew who spent a lot of time in staging practical sequences. Cinematographer George Steel does a descent job in making the film look visually appealing. Dear Netflix, please tell me you haven't already thrown money at a sequel.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

Heart of Stone,Al R,"I was really expecting to like this. When I read it was going to be a female-led action film, I heard ""feminism"" and rushed to watch because I need more of that in my viewing experience. This one let me down. I watched two hours of this movie and learned nothing about the main character. Where's she from? Did she have training prior to the Charter? How did she join? No idea. How did you make Gal Gadot boring?! In ""The Gray Man,"" Six has the personality of a pot of unstrained spaghetti; I hated him for most of the movie, and I still decided I liked him at the end solely because of his relationship with Clair and their little inside jokes (i.e., the rock-on 🤘🏻 hand signal, ""Just another Thursday,"" and ""Can I chew gum in here?""). We see Rachel interact with Bailey's cat, Barry, and drop off a present for Bailey's niece (I think?), but it feels glossed over. The movie's theme is teamwork, friendship, always having someone to watch your back — the main character acts alone for most of the movie. She has no one watching her back. Thus, the sentiment falls flat. As for the Charter, it needed a bigger build up. It needed to be glorified before it was torn down; as is, it just looks lackluster. We learn in exposition they're supposed to be the good guys. For some reason, they're using a super-invasive A.I. that would be the bad guy in every other movie. Why? They're supposed to be the best of the best and formidable; they appear to be terrible at their jobs at every possible turn. The fight scenes were actually boring to me. I don't know who was in charge of stunts, but I'm disappointed. And the cinematography? Boring as h*ll. No framing. Passed over the fight scenes like they weren't there. This movie was a cake without the floofers. Barry the cat and the shimmery dress Yang wore (I want it) carried the cake as far as they could, but they had no support and dropped it on the floor; it's covered in cat hair.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,Alon H,"The writing is atrocious. So horrendous, we stopped watching the film 10 minutes in. Even that was too much. Big budgets don't matter if the words are trash.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,Jithin K,"I really enjoyed the first 40 minutes which kinda felt like a budget Mission Impossible movie but then it started to try having a plot and then everything went downhill. I don't know if it is because they cast Alia that the score was a bit overblown like in Bollywood but without the mise-en-scene that such use of music should follow. As good as an actor Alia is, she had to work with Gal as an immature second fiddle which went as well as it can. Even though, I was enjoying it in the beginning it slowly turned very very boring towards the end. Still, can't deny how much fun I had the first 40 minutes.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,Ryan B,"I don't even know where to begin. Do I start with how bad the acting was? Or how about there's no 'feeling' in the movie.

Jamie D's acting was sometimes so cringey then other times good but not consistent. Some of the jokes were corny. Just a lot seemed unreal like a cartoon. The continuous story line of action, chases, fights was just so-so for me & the cinematography was just so-so too, very blurred, dark and some times cartoonish.

The plot and secret society is ridiculously silly but the cast is ok, although Gadot doesn't really have the charisma to be the lead. The film struggles to maintain your interest or keep momentum between the action scenes but it's entertaining enough spy fare if a bit on the uninteresting side. Would have been better with stronger villains and being shorter, but the special effects and globe-trotting was good.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

The story of a multilayered set of Intelligence Agencies engaging in spying and counter-espionage is good. The James Bond type spy elements make it watchable. The issues with this are multiple though. The special effects are not great, and, more importantly, they are unnecessary and cartoonish in many segments, which detracts from the credibility of the film. Additionally, the fight choreography is not good. This is especially true when Gadot is fighting. It is clearly not her and there is one scene they cut from stunt double to Gadot being choked that is about as bad as you will see in any ""B"" movie. It had a lot of action, and some heart. Not great, but watchable.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

Heart of Stone,Ian F,"It's a nice thing to have a night in occasionally. Watch a popcorn movie. Let it do the work. I thought this would fit the bill - it doesn't. Terrible cast. Feels like what Spooks would be like if they made a ‘TV film' of it. Cliched is good sometimes but it's not that or fun, thrilling or anything close to a compelling watch. No idea how this got made or why Gal Gadot got within 100 miles of it.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,tomer m,"I absolutely loved it.

Heart of Stone,Thaddeus L,"I absolutely loved this movie! Gal Gadot as usual carried this movie with great acting and intriguing plot. The action sequences were terrific and breathtaking at times and very reminiscent of Tom Cruise in Mission Impossible!

Heart of Stone,Cork B,"It's dumb. Real dumb. The kind of movie that made Dumb and Dumber look like Shakespeare, because at least that movie was trying to be funny. There are many many truly stupid scenes that I found painful to watch and are too numerous to even mention. Just for instance, if you are buried in a bunker with no air, and you have a phone, maybe you should call someone. Arghhh. What makes it even worse is they actually spent money on this thing. There are interesting locations, lots of stunts and even the CGI was decent. Too bad they didn't spend any of that money on the writing.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review

It's an action movie with lots of action scenes, the plot is not something new but it's what we basically see in Mission Impossible (and it's great), which this movie resembles a bit. Gal Gadot does a great job as also as the others actors. If you like action movies, just go for it! This is a great one.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review

Heart of Stone,Mark Ludwig S,"While this did not rise to the level of a Mission Impossible movie, it was something new and different. Gal Gadot was very good, and they did not make her some girl-power character. She doesn't always win. She gets beat up. She is in jeopardy. She makes mistakes. So, that was refreshing. The storyline kept me engaged, and all in all, it was 2 hours of entertainment I enjoyed. :-)","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review

Heart of Stone,Jerard L,The movie wasn't that good! I was hyped after watching the trailer but not sure making a franchise from it is a good idea! Stunts were very poor and so were the dialogues!,"Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,Gustavo Z,"Average at best. It took them 54 minutes to set up the film with ups and downs and an intro animation equally similar to Secret Invasion. From there on a second act that didn't do much really. Writing is not that well thought Third act had more action, obviously but is as much as generic as sometimes a carbon copy of MI movies. I expected more to be honest, very predictable since the firsts scenes, it is good if you have nothing else to watch. Wouldn't watch it again though.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,IceTravel G,"Awful movie Gal Gadot was horrendous in the role, story was abysmal","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,Phil P,"This movie raised two magnitudes more questions than it answered. This isn't a movie where if you think hard enough things don't make sense, this is a movie where if you think at all nothing makes sense. This movie aggressively confused me.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,Omar E,"We jump forward in a mission undertaken by a MI6 group of agents including our computer expert protagonist (Agent Stone). Their objective is to apprehend their target discreetly, and as expected their cover is blown, it gone north and the mess starts where we see Stone turns out to be lethal field agent work for a mysterious organization that possess a futuristic-tech device able to give accurate predictions and tracking people. And thus, our plot starts. The movie should fall in genre of Action, Mystery. While in my opinion, The mystery element is poorly fulfilled as it doesn't build up the curiosity for secrets being revealed for audience. At least for me,I wasn't excited at all to know any of this until they unveiled them. However, action scenes weren't that bad it was fine apart from those lousy scenes that required CGI which was clumsy in some shots I felt I was watching a video game story scene. Plot has nothing innovative, A maniac that loathes the world because of an organization leader who had to give order that saves bunch of lives and it's way it shatters the humanity in that maniac we mentioned so he devise a plan to steal a humongous powerful futuristic machine which will get him his redemption, how many movies the premise can apply to it??!! To sum it up, it was just a below-below average run-of-the-mill action movie with bland characters. On a side note, seriously Gal Gadot should find another job other than acting.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,Mc D,"OK action. Really really bad writing. I knew it would be bad in the opening sequence when a character actually said ""We have the arms dealer in sight.""

Heart of Stone,Richard B,"I liked this movie. It most definitely tries to emulate Mission impossible in a number of ways, which, on one hand is almost impossible to do, but this comes closer to achieving success than almost any other movie I have seen. and after the disappointment of dead reckoning, I thought this movie had beautiful locations, nice set pieces, and good stunt work.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,Shubham S,"The movie is flat. Very poor character development considering they might have planned for Franchise project. Action sequence have visual errors, glasses take their form back after crashing and countless. Satellite server was a good concept but the movie had to cast a 32 years Bollywood actress for a role of 22 year old hacker, who gets her jaw dropped in same fashion as Indian scammers get their jaw dropped when Youtubers hack into their systems and access their camera.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review

It lacked the spark for the viewer to care about the characters. When gal was part of the a team it was actually cool with the interplay between the characters but from the point at which this was lost the movie became pretty dull which is weird as there were some cool stunts. But it just seemed to go through the motions with a lack of time to let the movie breathe.

Heart of Stone,Larry T,"Now let's be honest. Is anyone surprised the results are not good when Gal Gadot steps outside of her comfort zone (looking pretty, generally in a sexy costume against dramatic backgrounds, maybe firing a Glock or punching somebody across an entire floor of a building) and instead tries to talk and convey human emotions in a starring role? We're just starting to forget ""Wonder Woman 1984"", a sinking ship which dragged Gadot, Chris Pine and Kristen Wiig down with it. Maybe Gal Gadot should have postponed taking another loud, mediocre star vehicle. She tries hard as she might, adopting a low, menacing voice and a steely-eyed stare, but her stiff, wooden performance is EXACTLY what we've seen from her in her previous movies. The cornball dialog and noisy, CGI-based action scenes just make matters worse. We all know the stars will survive without harm. It's just too bad we have to sit through the whole movie to witness the inevitable.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

This is that for mission impossible. I cannot believe how many action scenes are things that a mission impossible movie has already done and they just do it so much worse with quick cutting action and it is obviously greenscreens and special effects compared to Tom Cruise actually doing the stunts. The twist were obvious, the characters were not memorable at all and I don't care for them, all the action is quick cutting and/or had dark lighting to hide the stunt doubles this movie just fails on what makes a good action movie.

Heart of Stone,Gyver I,"I enjoyed it. It isn't that kind of Netflix movie where there's just too much cgi stuff everywhere. The action was great. Gal carried the movie. Story was of course not original, but watchable. Looking forward to more of Rachel Stone and her new team.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,Bob T,Disappointing! Makes little to no sense with way over the top cgi scenes that are totally unbelievable. Graphics are just plain silly and not believable trying to simulate a James Bond style of suspense that just goes into the realm of rediculisness. I barely was able to watch the whole movie. The only reason I watched it was because I I would watch Gail Gadot make paper dolls if nothing else was on. It is no Wonder this Woman is the only thing that held my interest!,"Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
Heart of Stone,Ryan R,Absolutely loved this movie and the critics really need to start rewarding films people actually watch! Rachel Stone is an amazing character and this is the best original Spy Genre film since Bourne Identity. I highly recommend it!,"Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

Bad Things,Nathaniel Muir,"Much like the sex-crazed horror movies of the 1980s, sexuality is just a part of the plot. Bad Things is loud and proud in its own way. It is a luxury that previous queer horror movies did not have. The focus is instead on the unraveling of its lead.","Jun 10, 2023",critic_review

Reinventing Elvis: The '68 Comeback,Laura G,"I saw the documentary in the theater and loved seeing Elvis' ""If I Can Dream"" performance on the large IMAX screen. Overall, I found the documentary entertaining, but I was surprised that so many great stories from Binder's book were left out. I guess I was thinking the documentary would include more (not fewer) of these tales. So that was a little disappointing. I still recommend the film, however, to anyone who wants to learn more about Elvis and the 1968 special. One thing I did like very much was the historical context, including background on Binder's career before the Elvis special. That was fantastic and not something you can get from Binder's book. Overall, this documentary is worth your time.","Aug 2, 2023",audience_review
Reinventing Elvis: The '68 Comeback,Frank P,"The movie was exactly what I'd hoped it would be: A real behind the scenes look into how and why the TV special was made. The juxtaposing of other events, (MLK and RFK murders) were important in order to understand what was happening at the same time, and how Elvis felt about it. Hearing from Steve Binder directly throughout was critical and authentic. You get a true sense of the inflection point in Elvis' career, and how this special helped reignite it. A great documentary!","Jul 31, 2023",audience_review
Reinventing Elvis: The '68 Comeback,janice d,When the movie got into the behind the scenes of the making of the ‘68 Special the movie was riveting.

No Hard Feelings,Mark Jackson,"Jennifer Coolidge's Stifler's mom in ""American Pie"" was a fun cougar. J-Law's Maddie Barker in ""No Hard Feelings"" won't exactly make you reach for your phone to call child protective services, but the thought will cross your mind.","Jun 26, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Dennis Schwartz,A raunchy comedy.,"Jun 25, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Patrick McDonald,"Once you get over what is a sex-worker-for-hire-on-Craigslist story, JLaw has a lotta cojones in taking this into the harsh light of Hard-R-rated land. But why must we learn lessons & have a redundant happy ending? And why is Matthew B. now Cameron's Dad?","Jun 25, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Korey Coleman,The story focuses more on friendship than it does on sex. It's actually a very sweet film.,"Jun 25, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Candice McMillan,"The game of ping pong that [Jennifer Lawrence] and [Andrew Barth Feldman] play ... is irresistible fun, and the walls they've both respectively built are joyously picked apart in the most unexpected comedy of the summer.","Jun 24, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Christian Toto,"Jennifer Lawrence is all in, but Oscar winner can't save conflicted comedy.","Jun 24, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Lynn Venhaus,"With jerky tonal shifts to make you feel as though you’re experiencing repeated whiplash, the movie veers off course in several directions that don’t make very much sense – not that we expect this format to be remotely plausible.","Jun 24, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Joe Friar,"Jennifer Lawrence gives 110% in a gutsy performance and Andrew Barth Feldman plays his part to perfection. It may be a bit watered down for young adults, but perfect for older moviegoers. Did you just walk out of a feel-good comedy? Yep.","Jun 24, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Steven Prokopy,No Hard Feelings has more heart and relatability than just about any other film I’ve seen from a Hollywood studio so far this year; it also has more laughs per minute than most of them as well.,"Jun 24, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Connor Petrey,"No Hard Feelings is a coming of age story told through two vastly different perspectives. This R-rated raunchy comedy may not always land, but the film excels with the relationships developed between characters and the performances leading the way.","Jun 24, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Joshua Starnes,No Hard Feelings is equally heartfelt and hilarious and will stick in the memory long after other modern comedies have come and gone. At the very least you’ll never look at someone getting suplexed the same way again.,"Jun 24, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Erik Childress,The film gets its big laughs but is ultimately a much sweeter (and even sadder) story that really comes to life thanks to the performances by Lawrence and Feldman as well as being one of the better eat-the-rich commentaries we have seen lately.,"Jun 24, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Christopher Lloyd,"Less funny and raunchy than you'd expect, along with some surprisingly hefty feels in the second half. Still plenty of laughs, including a gut-buster in which Jennifer Lawrence really goes for it. You'll know it when you see it.","Jun 23, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Todd Jorgenson,"Combining the cheesiness of a conventional romantic comedy with the raunch of a coming-of-age sex farce, this sharp suburban satire provides some consistent laughs even if its central scheme progresses and inevitably unravels in predictable fashion.","Jun 23, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Chris Bumbray,"For the most part, pretty funny with an excellent performance by Jennifer Lawrence.","Jun 23, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Rain Jokinen,"[T]oo much of the movie takes the tame route, seemingly not understanding that a modern raunchy sex comedy can have the sex, and the raunch, and still be worthy of a star like Jennifer Lawrence.","Jun 23, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Peter Travers,"This R-rated sex farce only plays at being dirty. Behind the carnal jokes lurks a Hallmark heart. But a never-friskier or funnier Lawrence, as a 30-ish Uber driver hired to seduce a college-bound kid, is well worth the watch. The rest gets a hard pass.","Jun 23, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Joe Lipsett,"No Hard Feelings loses a great deal of momentum (and nearly all of its jokes) when it moves into the back half of the film, [but] Lawrence is incredibly game for everything that the film asks of her, including some truly hilarious physical comedy","Jun 23, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Murtada Elfadl,"As a summer lark, this makes for a nice diversion. Yet it still feels like an opportunity missed. There could’ve been more laughs, the raunchy elements could’ve been pushed harder. A class satire is introduced but never explored.","Jun 23, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Kurt Loder,"I guess it's crass of me to go right to Lawrence's nude scene, but the studio — and presumably Lawrence herself, a producer on the film — is happy to play up the movie's raciest attraction.","Jun 23, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Frank Swietek,"Feels ambivalent about what sort of movie it wants to be—a raunchy sex farce or a sensitive study of two troubled people whose unlikely friendship helps both overcome their problems—and in trying to be both, it seems forced and unconvincing.","Jun 23, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Lauren Bradshaw,"No Hard Feelings has a lot of humor, even more heart, and a fantastic comedic performance from Lawrence, who uses her natural charisma and presence to make this an enjoyable comedy… and did I mention one scene in particular is going to break the internet?","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Lisa Johnson Mandell,"It's a tale that could have taken place any time in the last 40 years, give or take a few details, hence Boomers, Millennials, Gen Z, etc. can relate to it and laugh at it.","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Anthony Morris,"No Hard Feelings works because both leads are believable, likable, often funny characters you want to see succeed.

No Hard Feelings,Jim Schembri,"With a premise that feels like it was time-tripped from the sex-comedy era of the early-1980s, it's a consistently funny, innocuously naughty romp with just enough substance to keep it from being the throwaway offering it was otherwise destined to be.","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Peter Bradshaw,It shows what a comedy turn Lawrence can still be.,"Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Jude Dry,"The ridiculous scenarios are obviously meant to be funny, but they mostly feel contrived and arrive out of the blue, with little build-up to sudden forced outrageous.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Tara Brady,"No Hard Feelings is billed as a raunchy comedy, a description so inaccurate it evokes Nelson Muntz’s immortal take, in The Simpsons, on David Cronenberg’s Naked Lunch: “I can think of at least two things wrong with that title.”","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Josh Spiegel,Here is a movie star working her magic; let Jennifer Lawrence revive the romantic comedy. She deserves it.,"Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Nick Schager,"Exhibits a superficial interest in ribald revelry and yet, in most respects, neuters its wilder impulses.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Cody Dericks,"When the movie is merely a vehicle for Lawrence's comedic gifts, it's an enjoyable ride. ""No Hard Feelings"" deserves to be championed by film fans, if only so that more – and better – movies of its kind will be made.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Joey Magidson,"No Hard Feelings is a raunchy comedy with lots of heart, tons of laughs, and an aces turn from Jennifer Lawrence.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Roger Moore,"For all her efforts, Lawrence never quite hits that comic sweet spot. She can’t pull off that bowling-ball-of-brazen thing that Plaza, Schumer and Tiffany Haddish made their brassy brands.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,David Poland,I sat in that theater and laughed. My 13-year-old laughed. But I kept wanting the whole thing to be funnier. Then it struck me what the flaw was. The movie has almost no real stakes because it chooses the wrong lead.,"Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Carla Hay,It has few laugh-out-loud moments and mostly recycles crude clichés from 1980s comedies about nerds losing their virginities. Jennifer Lawrence's full-frontal nude scene reeks of desperation. This outdated movie is as edgy as a used condom from 1984.,"Jun 18, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Steven C,"If you want to see more of Jennifer Lawrence (wink, wink) this is a must see because she is beautiful. But seriously, I was in the mood for a good romantic comedy today. It delivers a little sadness, but is great with the punchlines. I don’t have a very good sense of humor anymore and most comedies fall short as just being dumb. So even if you are just interested in the comedic aspects, this one is good.","Jul 19, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,David R,"The girlfriend and I loved it. For the type of film it is, I wish there would have been some more scenes where Jennifer Lawrence could have really stretched her comedic muscles. But the scenes where she did stretch them, were funny and delivered. It just felt like there were quite a few scenes that could have been replaced for more comedic interactions between the two leads. She is one of the best all around actresses today, if not the best.","Jul 15, 2023",audience_review

It didnt take long to realize Id underestimated the film though, its just plain fun. The topics involved are handled well and the production comes across pretty self aware, in a good way.

I am a few generations removed from most of the kids in the movie they certainly reflect their current moral values.

No Hard Feelings,MaggieT,"Much sweeter movie than I expected. The beach naked scene was unnecessary and smutty, though, and demeaned Jennifer Lawrences strong acting reputation. Andrew Feldman was surprisingly good for a newcomer, and the chemistry of care and concern between the two was evident. Other than Lawrence, actors Benanti and Broderick were highlights as well!

No Hard Feelings,James W,"No one is going to accuse this of being high art, but I did enjoy it. The initial premise is a bit of a leap, but once you've accepted or made peace with the reasons why the main character has chosen to do what she's doing it does become as good as a raunchy comedy that can be made in the present cultural climate. It also does present an interesting relationship dynamic of a strong female and a passive male gradually turning the easy jokes made about their attributes into opportunities for both characters to learn and grow. Though hardly a spoiler alert, most stories that start with a deception usually do reach an ending that involves the reveal of that deception. Generally, how you feel about the movie overall is based on how the movie delivers that reveal. Though it went with one of several potential options for the reveal this one didn't stick the landing. To the positive, this choice did give an opportunity to do a callback to an earlier scene swapping the characters. However, even with the potential for traumas involved, the condition of the relationship leading into the callback was already at scorched-earth level, and it is hard to shut down the idea that there would still be some sense of resentment between them. (These thoughts make me really ""fun"" to go to movies with, I guess.) The other knock I have on this film is that it felt like it was written by an older writing team looking for opportunities to take shots at the current generation of potential college students. Not saying that each generation doesn't have its mockery points. I'm also saying that as many stick shift, rotary phones, cassette play, and cursive jokes going round that there likely is as unique an escape room hell for those of us in Gen X or the Boomer Generation with social media, QR codes, and random forms of activism most older people would have thought needless. The other interesting thing here was the older music used throughout the movie. It felt like it was written for those closer to their 40's than to those about to enter college. All that said, I did like the movie and am hopeful that it does well enough for studios to make and release comedic films with an adult nature. Since the pandemic ended it really seems like the only films making it to theaters are comic books, horror, or pretentious arty pieces clocking well over 2 hours. I'd almost forgotten how much fun a shorter, simpler, comedic movie at the theater can be.","Jul 3, 2023",audience_review

Performances are solid, especially Andrew Barth Feldman’s, but while there are good actors throughout the film, they just aren’t funny…the writing isn’t there. Straddled the line between over-the-top ridiculousness and sweetness, and often fell off. Final third of the film really doesn’t work well. Overall, the movie was fine, enjoyable, just not nearly as good as I was hoping.","Jul 2, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,Marshall Austin,"Jennifer Lawrence and the rest of the cast shine in the rarity that is R-rated comedies. Hollywood is so franchise focused that the common comedic outing without bells and whistles hardly makes it to the big screen anymore. However, Lawrence, who produces and stars here, doesn’t waste it. The film is hilarious, emotionally engaging, and ends on a sweet note. At times, the movie does seem awkward due to the logistics of an age gapped relationship that starts out purely transactional, but with the charismatic performances you don’t notice as much. Lawrence is truly back on top with No Hard Feelings.","Jul 2, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,Film Buff Spidey,The best Indiana Jones film since Raiders of the Lost Ark! I was shocked to say this as I heard many say only better than the last one. What a grounded Indy film this is until the third act but what a third act it is that I wont give away! The opening 20 minutes we get a mini throwback adventure to World War II Germany with a younger Indy which was phenomenal! No silliness in this one like we got so much of in Crystal Skull and in bits of Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade. All of the cast are great and I loved the story in this one. James Mangold takes over for Spielberg and does a fantastic job. John Williams once again delivers a classic Indy score that drives the film with excitement.,"Jul 1, 2023",audience_review

A little over acting by the adult actors. Jennifer Lawrence did an amazing job convincing me that she could change from wanting a Buick to wanting a friend. She also looked good in the fight scene. The final scene closed out the plot line, but left me a little disappointed.","Jul 1, 2023",audience_review

Don't sweat it if you miss it in the theater.","Jun 30, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,James R,Very uneven. About two thirds a good story and sometimes very funny. The rest of the movie was silly and boring with things like cars racing around with one of the stars clinging on the hood of the car. The movie could have been much better.,"Jun 28, 2023",audience_review
No Hard Feelings,Debra H,"This movie was so bad it was shocking that these great actors agreed to be in it. It had potential: a cute premise, great actors, and some really funny moments. But some of the scenes were so over the top as to be ridiculous instead of funny. And some of the situations were cringingly uncomfortable because if the genders were reversed, we would all find it completely offensive. Yet we were meant to laugh at it. I usually love movies like this and was pretty disappointed.","Jun 28, 2023",audience_review
No Hard Feelings,Evan,"This movie struggled to find its identify. It waffled between incredibly crass humor and PG-feel-good sentiments. I felt like Jennifer Lawrence read the script and found it funny, and her liking the script got this movie green-lit when it had no business being adapted to film without several more script revisions.","Jun 28, 2023",audience_review
No Hard Feelings,Kimberly R,Thought it was a cute movie. It made me laugh @ some of the craziest things. I could have done without the full front nudity of Jennifer Lawrence but besides that I enjoyed it. Desperate times call for some desperate measures.,"Jun 28, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,John S,"Cute, lively story that could be seen as a little creepy, but is kept so light hearted and funny, that you can't help but like both the characters. Surprisingly, seeing Matthew Broderick as a gray haired old man is the most creepy part. JLaw is great and it was an altogether enjoyable summertime movie.","Jun 28, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,edward t,"This movie knows what it is. A pure Hard R comedy. Full of over the top raunch, vulgar and not afraid to sneer. It doesn’t compete with the mid 2000’s heyday of comedies. But it is a firm and well done entry in that category.","Jun 28, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,jimmy jet,"The press on this movie had me set up to be slightly disappointed. Far from it, this was a rather endearing flick with story, funny, but not ridiculous moments, and some real thought provoking sub-plots. As previously reviewed, it wasn't much on raunchiness...but that is why I believe it creates so much empathy for the two main characters. I would certainly recommend it to my friends that aren't offended by a splash of nudity or the f-word. Glad I saw it on the big screen","Jun 27, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,Keiona,"A boost for studio comedies, providing the genre one of its funniest movies in a while with its wild, unrepentant raunch. Jennifer Lawrence is hysterical and gorgeous at the peak of her abilities, and Andrew Barth Feldman is on par with her. If you anticipate enjoying this, you probably will. I have fond memories of the huge, raunchy R-rated studio comedy from the early 2000s, and this isn't simply a flashback to those movies it also justly deserves to be ranked alongside them.","Jun 27, 2023",audience_review

See this in theaters!!!","Jun 26, 2023",audience_review
No Hard Feelings,Suzy T,"If you are looking for something fun and something fresh in the theatre this summer, get yourself a ticket to No Hard Feelings.

No Hard Feelings,Daryl,"Wonderful picture that takes you from sexy funniness to wonderful pathos and tenderness. Jennifer Lawrence is a beautiful woman that easily makes you fall in love with her character. More to the point, she is an amazingly talented actress whose range of emotions and comedy chops are both on display in No Hard Feelings. Andrew Feldman also a fine actor. He plays an awkward yet sweet geek to perfection. Mattew Broderick and Laura Benanti as the helicopter parents add a nice touch of realism that sells the premise of the picture. Very enjoyable evening at the movies!","Jun 26, 2023",audience_review

If you're after a fun time at the movies and just want to laugh for awhile, it's great for that.

It was lovely to see Jennifer Lawrence in this kind of role - reminded me a bit of her in American Hustle she can do anything! But the star really was the Andrew Barth Feldman who plays Percy. Wow - what a fine job he did as the introverted, geeky but earnest kid and can he sing and play piano!! We can't wait to see him on screen again. Again - it's summer get some popcorn and enjoy.","Jun 24, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,Tanay,"No Hard Feelings is the kind of summer movie pitch that feels like it’s plucked from the 2000’s and put into production in the 20’s. Jennifer Lawrence’s Maddy Barker is a struggling Uber ‘driver’ (skater) and agrees to date the extremely introverted kid of a rich couple for a Buick Regal. It’s a movie plot that comes with all the incoming gags about the age gap, lies and misunderstandings as feelings are played with and ultimately blowing up when the truth comes out. While the plot itself is basic, it feels refreshing to have a simple movie about financial hardships and the struggle to open yourself up and making friends in college, concepts that I’m all too familiar with and thus hit close to home as I sympathize with both Maddy and Percy’s perspectives. The supporting characters are fine for the most part, including a surprise Hasan Minhaj cameo which was crazy. At the end of the day, movies like these are meant to have fun for 2 hours, giggle at the awkwardness and leave you with a heartwarming feeling after a happy ending which is much appreciated. Besides, Andrew Barth Feldman put off going to Harvard to star in this movie (funny considering he was about to put off being a freshman at Princeton for Maddy in the movie) and Jennifer Lawrence gives an amazing comedic performance as Maddie, including a fully naked scene where she beats up creepy dudes on a beach, which aside from the movie itself, is a 10/10 scene from me. The audience in my theater were mostly people closer to Maddy’s age and they had a bunch of good laughs throughout the movie, while I’m 19 just like Percy and seeing things though his lens made the movie all the more relatable. It was a damn good time! No Hard Feelings Score: 7/10","Jun 23, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,Ali,"The movie was great! The rude audience, not so much. Sat in the wrong row I guess lol. Of course Right next to a guy sleeping and snoring so loud. Who goes to the movies to nap?! He missed the best part tho so karma. And people couldn’t stay off their phones! The movie itself was definitely worth it!","Jun 23, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,Justin,"Not the best time. A story that tried to be clever but was overshadowed by its uncomfortable scenes. Raunchy humor was awkward at times, age gap made it distasteful, & wrapped in a theme that doesn’t deliver the best message by the end. An absurd rom-com movie.","Jun 23, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,Niko,I thought it was really funny. Alot of the dialog was raunchy which I liked. I was really surprised to see Jennifer Lawrence fully naked in a movie. Even though most seen her naked on her leaks prior. It is a must see if you like her movies and comedy with some drama.,"Jun 23, 2023",audience_review
No Hard Feelings,ReviewedByNick,"#NoHardFeelings is an interesting comedy. It seems to be in lock step with past comedies like #AmericanPie or #ILoveYouBethCooper or even #Blockers. I really enjoyed the quirky and awkward chemistry of Jennifer Lawrence and Andrew Feldman. The scenes with the skinny dipping and the train had me laughing pretty hard. There are times when the dialogue was a bit rough to digest, but the film does enough to pull you through it. Feldman’s character was like looking at a mirror of myself from high school. Kept to myself, extremely introverted, and yeah a loser haha. So I could actually relate to him in some regards lol. But overall, while the comedy is there, towards the 3rd act, things get a bit serious, but not too serious where it turns into an outright drama. Which is good, because I enjoyed the comedy and it was nice to finally go see a true comedy in theaters again. I give No Hard Feelings: 3.5 Maneaters Out of 5.","Jun 23, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,Google,"Well acted, but nowhere near as funny as I had hoped. This isn't a laugh out loud comedy. It's a drama with a few minor chuckles. And the ending is very lame and not fun.","Jun 23, 2023",audience_review
