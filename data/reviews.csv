The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Stephen A. Russell,"Did we really need this Dracula footnote to set sail at all? Perhaps not, but while Øvredal’s expansion on the world isn’t as fun as the grim fables from which it draws blood, it still has some bite.","Sep 9, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Felix Vasquez Jr.,"It’s just such a well executed, relentlessly grim, and creepy horror entry with a Dracula we’ve never actually seen before.","Sep 6, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Ruben Peralta Rigaud,"There is a lack of ideas, both in terms of staging and content, in order to keep the audience happy. [Full review in Spanish]","Aug 31, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Mel Valentin,"Either the undercooked screenplay needed to marinate for another decade or two or, more likely than not, the promise inherent in the premise was never meant for anything more than what it always was, a chapter in Stoker’s novel.","Aug 31, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Todd Jorgenson,"Consistently creepy yet rarely terrifying, this flat spinoff doesn’t make any meaningful additions to the mythology of the source material.","Aug 30, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Nicolás Delgadillo,There’s a brief novelty to the bloody spectacle that Øvredal’s latest provides but this supposed final voyage feels considerably thin by its end,"Aug 30, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,"It manages to develop a tense and slightly bloody story, where all sexuality has been removed from Dracula in order to portray him as a true monster. It could have been better, but it's not like I regret seeing it at the cinema. Full review in Spanish.","Aug 29, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,DarkSkyLady,"While not the best vampire film, its phenomenal visuals, cast, and tense moments make The Last Voyage of the Demeter worth watching.","Aug 26, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Terence Johnson,"Though there is much to decry about the film, there’s enough present here to make the price of a ticket worth your while. Just get ready to queue up some quiet music when you leave the theater.","Aug 26, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Mark McPherson,"Dracula may fare well at sea, but his film mostly sinks under its weight of cliche-strewn course.","Aug 25, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Jeffrey M. Anderson,"After many, many Dracula/vampire movies, a good, simple idea like this one works surprisingly well, thanks to the fixed, moody setting, intricate sound design, and an eerie, malevolent monster.","Aug 25, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Walter Chaw,"I do wonder what Øvredal would have made of a Norse monster rather than one born of a British imagination. For what it is, it's good enough.","Aug 25, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Adrián Monserrat,"Directed by such an expert in the genre like André Øvredal and gifted with a score composed by Thomas Newman, The Last Voyage of the Demeter sets up the fantasy but fails to bring the terror. [Full review in Spanish]","Aug 24, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Alex Barr,"After reading the brief plot description, you’ve practically seen the movie.","Aug 24, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,La Nación (AR) Staff,The enactment of life aboard a merchant ship and the disturbing atmosphere of this journey at the turn of the XIX century are amongst the best elements of this uneven adaptation. [Full review in Spanish],"Aug 24, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Micheal Compton,"In the end The Last Voyage of the Demeter doesn’t totally suck, but it lacks the bite it needs to separate it from the multitude of Dracula cinematic entries.","Aug 22, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Abby Olcese,"The story is tragic, the vibes are excellent, and the ensemble sells every minute. It may feel subdued, but you’ll probably still leave with a satisfying chill.","Aug 22, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Edwin Arnaudin,Commendable atmosphere and creature design can’t save a horrendous screenplay.,"Aug 22, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Rob Gonsalves,"It’s a long wait between killings, and the killings are never very impressive or even distinct from each other.","Aug 22, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Joe Lipsett,"André Øvredal should be a great choice to bring tension and scares, but he's on autopilot and his great cast has nothing to do. Cobweb's Woody Norman fares best, in part because his character has the best sequence.","Aug 22, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Linda Cook,"It's old-school story telling - as it should be, considering its origin - that never pulls back from the gore.","Aug 22, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Alci Rengifo,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter will certainly not be the last time Dracula is resurrected for a movie, but this take on the old monster has all the lifeblood sucked out of it.","Aug 21, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Korey Coleman,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a relentless, heartless film. This type of bleak movie won't resonate with most audiences. Corey Hawkins really get to show his range.","Aug 21, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Jackie K. Cooper,"Dark, ominous, chilling equals fun in viewing an above average vampire movie.","Aug 19, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Sarah Vincent,"This loose, bloated adaptation of “Log of the Demeter,” an excerpt from a chapter in Bram Stoker’s “Dracula,” could’ve used more bite.","Aug 19, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Sabina Graves,"Overall the film starts off on some rough waters, but once it gets down to Dracula going full terror on the sea versus a standout Corey Hawkins as the film’s hero, it’s riveting and heartbreaking.","Aug 18, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Erick Estrada,"Beyond being an exciting, effective and well-made horror, this is not an extravagant movie... [Full review in Spanish]","Aug 18, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Nick Johnston,"What’s really gear-grinding is the depiction of Dracula himself, which is just frustrating in all the ways you’d expect a movie trying to make use of and differentiate itself from a hundred-or-so years of vampire films would be.","Aug 18, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Alonso Duralde,"[The filmmakers] don't make the most of the claustrophobia of the ship, and at the same time, they don't give you the vast expanse of the seas, either.","Aug 18, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Christy Lemire,It just feels very stale and bland.,"Aug 18, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Kelly Vance,"The writing, acting and production values are of an unexpected high quality reminiscent of the work of such old-school fright factories as Universal Studios in the 1930s-‘40s and Hammer Films of the 1960s.","Aug 18, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,David Nusair,...a compelling premise that’s employed to watchable yet increasingly erratic effect...,"Aug 18, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Michael Atkinson,"The hey-great-idea feeling you might’ve entertained gets worn down quickly and thoroughly, and it’s hard not to come away with the sense that all the previous Draculas got it right by having most of the Demeter’s ordeal happen entirely off-screen.","Aug 18, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Chris Klimek,The Last Voyage of the Demeter expands a chapter of Dracula into a modest fright-gathering rather than a full-on frightfest.,"Aug 17, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Dwight Brown,The whole production seems lost at sea.,"Aug 16, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Luke Y. Thompson,"To call The Last Voyage of the Demeter predictable is like calling Count Dracula a carnivore – absolutely self-evident, yet still underselling things just a bit.","Aug 16, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Paul Salfen,"Given that the director brought us one of the last truly scary movies, The Autopsy of Jane Doe, you might think this one might have some chills and thrills - and it just doesn't. It drags on and on with no hint of spookiness until it's too late.","Aug 16, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Leigh Paatsch,"As this well-made movie is essentially an effective exercise in mood management, we are made to wait until the real star of the show makes his unpleasant presence felt...

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Jonathan Sim,"Although the movie does not reach its full potential, particularly with the paranoia aspect the premise offers, it remains a simple, effective nightmare. It’s bloody, exciting, and everything you would expect.","Aug 16, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Erik Childress,"A film that never rises to the level of isolation it needs to develop genuine dread, too often sidelining Cunningham and Dastmalchian and becoming little more than serving up one character attack on deck and searching of limited confines in the daylight.","Aug 16, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Maxance Vincent,The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a dull retread.,"Aug 16, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Abbie Bernstein,What’s perhaps most pleasurable about The Last Voyage of the Demeter is that it is unironic vampire horror.,"Aug 14, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Keith Garlington,“Demeter” is as gripping as it is gruesome. It’s a dread-drenched stop on the Dracula timeline that has enough to please the iconic villain’s long-time fans and plenty to win over new ones as well.,"Aug 14, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Howard Waldstein,"It should’ve been an elaborately conceived thrill-kill horror, but it instead stays in one gear: day breaks, accusations are hurled, night falls, people die, repeat for nigh on two hours.","Aug 14, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Sean Burns,"'Alien' meets 'Master and Commander' is a hell of a hook for a horror film, which leaves one wondering how they managed to screw it up so badly.","Aug 14, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Chris Joyce,"The makeup and practical effects are brilliantly executed, crafting gore and a creature that can fuel nightmares. While the pacing may be too slow in spots and this lacks a scary vibe, the acting and drama work to create a grimly dire film.","Aug 12, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Sara Michelle Fetters,"The film is a great deal of insidious fun, and I have a sneaky suspicion that my fondness for it will only grow as I return to it again and again over the coming years.","Aug 12, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Matthew Jackson,"It’s not the best Dracula film you’ll ever see, but it is a chilling new spin on the character, and a voyage horror fans will mostly be glad they took.","Aug 12, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Adam Olinger,"A formulaic yet effective take on the horror icon, Dracula. The Last Voyage of the Demeter nails the atmosphere, the creature design and the crew of this ship. An easy watch with potential for more in the future!","Aug 12, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,John Urbancich,"No yo-ho-ho's here, though, or bottles of rum, either, as told from just one chapter of the late-19th century, Bram Stoker novel that introduced the ""Prince of Darkness"" and, eventually, bloodsucking as a spectator sport.","Aug 12, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Tanner Gordon,"As the charred and barren Demeter finally lands on English shores, it’s hard not to get the sense that this underbaked and overlong film, like most of its crew, is largely dead on arrival.","Aug 12, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Lisa Johnson Mandell,"André Øvredal directs, and while his palette is dark and murky and it’s often hard to discern who’s doing what to whom, he makes some terrifying choices that leave you wrecked, defying tired horror movie tropes.","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Matt Rodriguez,"Told through the Captain's own logs, the horror film paints a brutal and bloodthirsty portrait of Dracula that is to be feared. The Last Voyage of the Demeter hits you like a stake through the heart; it's gruesome, scary, and unrelenting.","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Jeff York,"It builds an ever-increasing sense of dread with each new scene, but even more impressive is how shrewd it is, filling the screen with smart characters, sly twists, and a sense of morality.","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Bilge Ebiri,"What truly distinguishes Last Voyage of the Demeter, beyond its thick atmosphere of dread, is its gleeful cruelty, the delicious mean streak with which it sets up its suspense set pieces and its kills.","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,A.A. Dowd,It’s B-movie pulp executed with just the right amount of Masterpiece Theatre classiness — a refined monster mash.,"Aug 11, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Andrew Wyatt,"For genre devotees who are jonesing for the distinctive pleasures of a lushly produced, 1800s-set supernatural thriller, Øvredal’s film will feel like a properly bloody steak dinner after a long, demoralizing fast.","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Albert Williams,"Predictable, gruesome, but unscary...","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Leo Brady,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a rocky trip, with moments that shock, moments that underwhelm, and a movie that I respect more than I loved. This Voyage had just enough bite to keep me aboard.","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Aaron Peterson,"An intriguing idea, well-crafted and atmospheric, though its script unfortunately pits our fanged nightmare against a crew stacked with dimwitted short-sightedness.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Michael Gingold,"Right from the start, Øvredal gives great atmosphere...[as] LAST VOYAGE becomes a claustrophobic survival saga akin to ALIEN or THE THING.","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Mark Dujsik,"The central idea of The Last Voyage of the Demeter is too good to simply write off the movie... That approach, though, is simply too formulaic to give the movie too much credit...","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Julian Roman,The Last Voyage of the Demeter had the base elements to be terrifying. What we get is a painfully slow slog through tired genre tropes. The characters don't have an ounce of self-preservation or rationality.,"Aug 11, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Robert Kojder,This Alien-inspied take on Dracula may not take full advantage of its premise and intriguing character dynamics but is elevated by dread and a strong ensemble injecting enough emotion to offset a subpar script,"Aug 11, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Charles Koplinski,"Much like the titular vessel, Andre Ovredal’s “The Last Voyage of the Demeter” is doomed from the start.","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Kyle Anderson,"If you want a mindless escape with a monster and some jump scares, The Last Voyage of the Demeter is plenty fine. If you wanted a truly fresh take on cinema’s most enduring creature of the night, keep looking.","Aug 11, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Elliott Collins,"It does a good job of creating a creepy atmospheric environment and stays consistent in tone. Performances evaluate this VERY blend narrative but. This chapter of a novel falls short in many ways, one being the story which doesn’t support the runtime.","Aug 10, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Derek Smith,"The film suggests a gene splice of a slasher flick and supernatural horror. But as enticing as that combination may sound, André Øvredal’s rendering of it is as bland and listless as the blues and grays that dominate the film’s color palette.","Aug 10, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Maggie Lovitt,"The Last Voyage of the Demeter is a deliciously terrifying vampire tale, which is fully immersed in the tumultuous terror of suspense.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Frank Swietek,"A surprisingly handsome picture, but not an especially invigorating or frightening one....the repetitiveness extracts the tension from the stately-paced movie as surely as Dracula drains the blood from his victims.","Aug 10, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Joshua Rivera,"It’s a film with no vision, a puzzling adaptation that’s so straightforward, viewers might believe every beat comes from Stoker’s novel and not a screenplay imagining what happened between the pages.","Aug 10, 2023",critic_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Fred Topel,"The style of Demeter feels like it could fit right in the middle of Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 Dracula adaptation.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Richard Crouse,"Built of tension and fear, it makes for an old-fashioned fright fest.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Michael Balderston,"While there's a base level of enjoyment to be had with The Last Voyage of the Demeter, it is not a vital addition to the legend of Dracula.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Clint Worthington,"There’s no real need for a film like this to exist, especially considering we know how it’ll all turn out.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Chase Hutchinson,"Even with all its promise, it is something even more horrifying which comes to define the experience: banality.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Nicole Ackman,"Øvredal might not have created something that will completely define vampire cinema for years to come, but he did create something unique, born out of a novel over a hundred years old, and that’s worth celebrating.","Aug 10, 2023",critic_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Jim Slotek,"Øvredal can sustain a mood, and the cast subtly slides into their realization of doom.

These are monumental developments that every movie should have. And the creature makeup and acting were all well done and aided in bringing the viewer into the story. I like how closely this movie followed the book. And i really liked how this story is told differently than other vampiric tales as you see how the story unfolds on the ship. Usually these stories are told mostly on land. As for the system that assigns seat, they double booked our seats so we had to sit in seats that werent as good.","Aug 28, 2023",audience_review

The atmosphere and production is fantastic at the beginning the story was not the best I've ever seen but was serviceable enough to make the setting and stings fairly effective. Unfortunately, this movie has a clear and definitive ending but didn't really know how to get there. After the strong setup, the characters start having to make dumb decisions to have the movie end up where it wants to be, and most of the goodwill it builds at the start kinda crashes down.","Aug 27, 2023",audience_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,PAUL,"It reminded me of some of my favorite horror films such as: The Shining, The Lighthouse, Shutter Island and of course, Nosferatu. There were a couple of scenes that truly startled me to the point of emitting an audible gasp. The apparent set up for a sequel at the end surprised me and kind of put me off. I expect that to happen when seeing a Marvel blockbuster but not with a film like this. I do like that they cast the Clemens character as an educated black man. All in all a very satisfying scary movie that I would say is destined to become a classic.","Aug 26, 2023",audience_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Kompewterbleu,"I haven’t read any of the reviews, but I can say I’ve seen quite a few vampire movies and this is a modern classic for me. I go back to the 70’s. Suspenseful, thrilling, scary…the cinematography, set design, costumes were all on point. The creature was one of the better interpretations I can recall. I’m not sure what Rotten Tomatoes has set for critiquing a movie because the pan some really good movie and praise a lot of junk. Text on par with the Academy Award panel…straight trash lately. And viewers well, I heard some of the naysayers leaving the theater and most of the negativity was for another reason.","Aug 16, 2023",audience_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Violet P.,"I really appreciated that the film focused on developing the story and did not rely on gore and guts. Of course there was some but not to the extent that it was the main focus. The portrayal of the ship itself was impressive, my one criticism is that they spoiled their own ending by beginning with it. For those who have read Dracula it's not critical but for those who have not read the book, it's a spoiler. Overall, I enjoyed it but the script did not address a couple strategies that would be obvious to anyone on that ship. Overall, I am glad I went.","Aug 16, 2023",audience_review
The Last Voyage of the Demeter,James C,"A very good story overall! It's an expansion of the ""Clipping from the Captain's Log"" chapter from Bram Stoker's novel Dracula. We learn more about the crew and the fate of the Demeter in this story. The dialogue, acting, scenery, set design, everything pretty much falls right into place here. This could almost be an addition to the novel, and it would almost fit right in. There were a few ""huh?"" moments in the movie. If I recall correctly, and keep in mind, it's been years since I've read the book, Dracula could not cross over water. This is why had to be transported in the crates of his home soil. But, he flies out onto the lifeboat... Also, why did it take Anna an entire day to tell her story of Dracula being on board? Hello, you could have spit that out as soon as you woke up, so that something could have been done about it sooner! But, then, there wouldn't be the rest of the novel, I suppose! I would have LOVED to have seen a tie-in with 1992's Bram Stoker's Dracula! Imagine it - Clemens is walking through London when he spies Gary Oldman and Winona Ryder conversing outside the cinematograph! Or, dining and drinking absinthe! THAT would have made me squeal with glee!","Aug 16, 2023",audience_review

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,Lucy,"It's a interesting telling of a part of the Dracula novel that received little attention in the original book.

The Last Voyage of the Demeter,ET,"Well, as a die hard Dracula fan, I'd say this one did it for me. Suspense, and actually fear and dread, from the very start. The suspense and fear remain consistent throughout the entire movie. Was a little skeptical about the plot, because how many times and ways can you tell the story of Dracula - right? Focusing on the Demeter and the cursed voyage of this ship was a clever new way to pull off an old horror story though, and it works. I was happy to be filled with suspense and dread the whole time, and truly scared with each viewing of the horrible, inhuman Dracula character. The movie starts out with sneak previews of him that build with fear, dread and intensity the entire time because his appearance grows more horrible with each sequence. For Dracula fans, or even if you just enjoy scary movies, it's worthy entertainment. I give it a thumbs up.","Aug 14, 2023",audience_review

Could have started the story with the captain reading his log as opposed to a flashback that reveals the state of the ship, even though most people know the story of Dracula arriving in London.

No Hard Feelings,Elliott Collins,"JENNIFER LAWRENCE finally gets to flex her comedic chops but after the initial opening moments, the film falls apart & painfully crawls into the second half. The film struggled to find a balanced and consistent tone.","Jul 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Devansh Sharma,"The best part about No Hard Feelings is that it doesn't limit itself to a ‘sex’ comedy. It turns that gaze inside and extends its purpose to an intense, meaningful romantic comedy.","Jul 20, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Lauren Veneziani,Jennifer Lawrence & Andrew Barth Feldman are a match made in comedic heaven. I laughed throughout in the theatre!,"Jul 20, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Zach Pope,I can recommend this film as a good solid comedy that is honestly more of a dramedy aspect of anything. This is a hard R Raunchy aspect that we don't get all too often.,"Jul 20, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Stephen Silver,"Lawrence is wonderful, and the film is frequently hilarious, sporting a half-dozen outstanding comedic set-pieces","Jul 13, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Diego Batlle,"No Hard Feelings isn't extraordinary... but it is a raunchy comedy reminiscent of erotic-youth ""classics"" such as American Pie or Porky's that shies away from the current compulsive search for prestige and political correctness. [Full review in Spanish]","Jul 12, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Edwin Arnaudin,"Earns big laughs, particularly from a scene of intense bravery by Lawrence that, if it wasn’t so graphic, would almost certainly play in the montage of clips at her future career achievement award ceremonies.","Jul 10, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Bruce R. Miller,"Jennifer Lawrence, however, deserves a stronger script to really justify the work she’s asked to put in. She can bring the laughs (Andrew Barth Feldman can, too), but she’s expected to do too much.","Jul 10, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Jonathan Sim,"An R-rated theatrically released comedy is a rare beast, after all. And while this film might be too bawdy for some, and it isn’t quite as strong as Stupnitsky’s other work, it’s a sterling example of sex comedy gone right.","Jul 6, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Kristen Maldonado,"The relationship between Maddie and Percy feels forced as her attempts to get his attention are so aggressive and manic.

No Hard Feelings,Paul Salfen,"Despite it being about some troubled and sometimes mean-spirited people, the movie does have its high points and some really funny cringey humor.

No Hard Feelings,Natasha Alvar,"There's a reason why Jennifer Lawrence is one of the youngest Oscar winners. She plays Maddie with such nuance and complexity, and delivers a performance that will make viewers forget the shadiness of the film's premise.","Jun 28, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Leonard Maltin,"I am about to recommend a mildly raunchy R-rated comedy for one simple reason: I had fun watching it.

No Hard Feelings,Rafer Guzman,"Questions abound -- about sex, class and basic morality -- and an R-rated comedy like this one might seem ill-equipped to handle them. What a pleasant surprise, then, to find that the movie has more going on under its hood.","Jun 27, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Tom Shone,"None of No Hard Feelings’s big set piece scenes works, largely because Percy hasn’t been conceived as anything other than the butt of the joke, and the mean-spiritedness leaves the film with nowhere to go.","Jun 26, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Kevin Maher,"The premise is never once credible, and director and co-writer Gene Stupnitsky peppers this astoundingly unfunny film with implausible set pieces that have clip-worthy kudos and nothing else.","Jun 26, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Brian Viner,"It’s a romantic comedy so feebly constructed, so lazily written, so devoid of wit and charm, that the ghost of Billy Wilder must be choking on his celestial cigar.","Jun 26, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Mark Jackson,"Jennifer Coolidge's Stifler's mom in ""American Pie"" was a fun cougar. J-Law's Maddie Barker in ""No Hard Feelings"" won't exactly make you reach for your phone to call child protective services, but the thought will cross your mind.","Jun 26, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Lynn Venhaus,"With jerky tonal shifts to make you feel as though you’re experiencing repeated whiplash, the movie veers off course in several directions that don’t make very much sense – not that we expect this format to be remotely plausible.","Jun 24, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Joe Friar,"Jennifer Lawrence gives 110% in a gutsy performance and Andrew Barth Feldman plays his part to perfection. It may be a bit watered down for young adults, but perfect for older moviegoers. Did you just walk out of a feel-good comedy? Yep.","Jun 24, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Connor Petrey,"No Hard Feelings is a coming of age story told through two vastly different perspectives.

No Hard Feelings,Peter Travers,"This R-rated sex farce only plays at being dirty. Behind the carnal jokes lurks a Hallmark heart.

No Hard Feelings,Richard Crouse,No Hard Feelings aims to find a sweet spot between racy comedy and heartfelt friendship story and misses the mark on both counts.,"Jun 22, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Mick LaSalle,"Basically, “No Hard Feelings” is everything you like about Jennifer Lawrence, brought together in one movie and then magnified: her down-to-earth irreverence, her comic timing, her idiosyncratic naturalness and her unexpected sensitivity.","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Casey Chong,"Jennifer Lawrence and Andrew Barth Feldman share great chemistry in this raunchy, yet surprisingly heartfelt comedy","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Anthony Morris,"No Hard Feelings works because both leads are believable, likable, often funny characters you want to see succeed. When the jokes don't work there's still reason to keep watching; when the jokes do - and they do most of the time - it's a winner.","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Jim Schembri,"With a premise that feels like it was time-tripped from the sex-comedy era of the early-1980s, it's a consistently funny, innocuously naughty romp with just enough substance to keep it from being the throwaway offering it was otherwise destined to be.","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Jeanne Kaplan,"NO HARD FEELINGS is truly humorous, helped immensely by Lawrence and Feldman’s terrific chemistry and adeptness for comedy.","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,David Kaplan,"Jennifer Lawrence exudes just the right amount of sexuality, humor and empathy required to make NO HARD FEELINGS a comedy with heart rather than an absurd endeavor.","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Julian Roman,Jennifer Lawrence gets hilariously raunchy in a sweet-natured sex comedy with surprisingly relevant themes. No Hard Feelings doesn't hold back from the risqué.,"Jun 22, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Avi Offer,"Mostly unfunny, witless and asinine. In a double feature with There's Something About Mary, it would be the vastly inferior B-movie. Jennifer Lawrence is miscast.","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Brian Eggert,"Sometimes, a moviegoer wants to be scandalized, but No Hard Feelings isn’t that kind of movie.","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Bob Bloom,"'No Hard Feelings”'is cute, comfortable, tame and safe. Writers John Phillips and Gene Stupnitsky — who also directed — seem to shy away from injecting any edginess into the proceedings.","Jun 22, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Laura Clifford,"Not everything works, but Lawrence and her costar Feldman develop genuine emotion out of crude comedy cloth.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Jake Coyle,"No Hard Feelings works better than it ought to. The preposterousness of the set-up is, naturally, part of the joke.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Enid Román Almansa,"Finally, a comedy that, although it does not escape most clichés, it uses them to its advantage to create a story that will make you leave the cinema with the strange feeling of having seen something new. [Full review in Spanish]","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Jonathan W. Hickman,"While the messy process of maturation is the underlying theme (Maddie and Percy have placed themselves in an insular box), this movie resolves the dilemma shallowly.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Tara Bennett,"No Hard Feelings may be marketed as just a raunchy, 2000s-era throwback comedy, but Lawrence and her co-star, Andrew Barth Feldman, elevate it into something more.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Mike Massie,"It may be amusing to see a 2023 take on a genre that has been stagnant for a considerable stretch, but this film just doesn’t have the right combination of raunchiness and heart to make for a worthwhile foray.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Glenn Kenny,"Lawrence is a consistently incandescent screen presence, and her role lets her run through her greatest performative hits, so to speak.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Tessa Smith,"Surprisingly charming at time, this movie offers more than just some laugh out loud humor, it delivers heart too. Great lead performances but something still feels a bit off -- almost like you shouldn't be watching this relationship unfold.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Brian Orndorf,"Isn’t quite the painful nougie pre-release footage has promised, stuck somewhere in the middle of silly and sincere, with Lawrence always game to supply some much-needed sass to help save droopy moments.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Mark Meszoros,"Instead of leaning into the raunchy sex-comedy vibes the trailers for the movie so proudly tout, director and co-writer Gene Stupnitsky works overtime to establish an emotional, heartfelt center to the affair that it never really earns.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Travis Hopson,"But for every gag that pushes the boundaries of good taste, No Hard Feelings offers a bit of depth that makes Lawrence’s presence crucial.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Alonso Duralde,"If contemporary American cinema insists on having its cake and eating it when it comes to mixing the sour and the sweet, at least a film like No Hard Feelings spotlights the ability of an actor like Lawrence to deliver both with complete sincerity.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Wenlei Ma,"No Hard Feelings is surprisingly smart and tender, and balances the difficult task of being gross-out funny and achingly sweet.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Mikel Zorrilla,"There's a tender component to the film so that the public becomes fond of its protagonists, which diminishes the comedic charge to benefit a story we all know where it's going to end. [Full review in Spanish]","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Brian Lloyd,'No Hard Feelings' is one of those comedies where the funniest moments are in the trailer and everything on either side of this is a rom-com that's far too bland and doesn't have nearly enough of an edge to it.,"Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Sophie Butcher,"Much better appreciated as an unlikely friendship story than the raunchy comedy it’s billed as, No Hard Feelings is formulaic but fun, fuelled by the lead pair’s engaging chemistry.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review
No Hard Feelings,Nate Richard,"Lawrence flexes her comedy muscles in both her dialogue and physical comedy, taking some bold swings with some of the things she does on screen, and it pays off extremely well.","Jun 21, 2023",critic_review

No Hard Feelings,Steven C,"If you want to see more of Jennifer Lawrence (wink, wink) this is a must see because she is beautiful. But seriously, I was in the mood for a good romantic comedy today. It delivers a little sadness, but is great with the punchlines. I don’t have a very good sense of humor anymore and most comedies fall short as just being dumb. So even if you are just interested in the comedic aspects, this one is good.","Jul 19, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,David R,"The girlfriend and I loved it. For the type of film it is, I wish there would have been some more scenes where Jennifer Lawrence could have really stretched her comedic muscles. But the scenes where she did stretch them, were funny and delivered. It just felt like there were quite a few scenes that could have been replaced for more comedic interactions between the two leads. She is one of the best all around actresses today, if not the best.","Jul 15, 2023",audience_review

It didnt take long to realize Id underestimated the film though, its just plain fun. The topics involved are handled well and the production comes across pretty self aware, in a good way.

No Hard Feelings,Joey N,"Cute movie that just touched on Jennifers amazing talent, in this odd romantic comedy whose plot of a socially awkward young man can be at times difficult to watch.

No Hard Feelings,MLS,"Jennifer Lawrence demonstrates her acting skills yet again by delivering a natural, easy performance that is completely characteristic of her and served as the reason to see the film in the first place. Her knack for physical comedy, wisecracks, and ability to exhibit a full register of emotions makes me think of one of her great predecessors in the same mold: Lucille Ball.","Jul 8, 2023",audience_review

No Hard Feelings,Barbara M,"Didn't like the beginning of the plot, Jennifer's character was unrealisticly pushy and abrasive towards the male lead, she didn't seem believable.

No Hard Feelings,Richard M,"Cute movie overall with a current story line of an over sheltered son about to go to college. I am a few generations removed from most of the kids in the movie they certainly reflect their current moral values. A good laugh for a lot of the situations that arise and the only reason the movie got a ""R"" rating was the one nude scene on the beach.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Mira Fox,"Not much has changed for Indiana Jones.

If having a younger version of Indy is so important, just recast the character. It all just feels so…empty","Jun 29, 2023",critic_review
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Paula Vázquez Prieto,"An effective alchemy, without breaking the mold or pretense, but very, very enjoyable. [Full review in Spanish]","Jun 29, 2023",critic_review
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Grace Randolph,"Mangold gives Indiana Jones the ""Logan"" treatment, but does anyone want a bleak & depressing Indiana Jones movie? Powerful and bold ending that sticks with you, but not the beloved franchise we all know and love. For fans only, to see how it all ends...","Jun 29, 2023",critic_review
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Alan Corr,It’s a breezy two-and half-hours of gleeful escapism with a frankly batty ending that will leave scholars of timeslip narratives happy.,"Jun 29, 2023",critic_review
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Katie Walsh,"Helena quips annoyingly, Indy grumbles predictably, and Mangold stuns us into a stupor with his perfectly competent filmmaking. It is a crushingly dull film until it becomes jaw-droppingly cartoonish.","Jun 29, 2023",critic_review
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Christopher Machell,"The Last Crusade will always be the natural ending to the series, but if we must have another last one, Dial of Destiny is about as fitting a final entry as we could hope for, if a minor one.","Jun 29, 2023",critic_review
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Patrick Cavanaugh,"A farewell party that no one asked for and one that could have ended earlier, but a worthy party if for no reason other than debuting the scene-stealing Phoebe Waller-Bridge as Helena Shaw.","Jun 29, 2023",critic_review
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Jan Lee,"[It's] is a very competently made film, with a final act that is admirably audacious... But after 40 years of tentpoles featuring dinosaurs, aliens, robots, wizards and superheroes, it is hard to make an artefact-hunting action-adventure feel fresh again.","Jun 29, 2023",critic_review

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Christopher Llewellyn Reed,"The film is far from a masterpiece, but it contains plenty of entertainment value and many thrills (if violent ones). It’s a good place to end. I think we can let Indy go now.","Jun 29, 2023",critic_review

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Dave,"I loved the movie! I have been a fan since Raiders came out and have a couple of the Jones fedoras that even my 17 year old daughter loves. The mix of fast paced adventure and the careful, thoughtful Indian Jones were done well as usual. I enjoyed seeing Sala come back and living in the states now. I also love how they answered what had occurred with Mutt in the intervening 12 years. Finally, the fact that Marion was there and acting just like Marion, along with the old lines from the original Raiders of the Lost Ark was a perfect finish. I only regret that the franchise won't continue for future generations to find the heroes and heroines as well as the almost fun ways they overcome the bad guys. Loved Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny...Hate to see it go!","Sep 5, 2023",audience_review

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Richard,I thought it was a terrific swan song for the franchise and especially for Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones. A lot of nice cameos from the original and interesting new characters. It is more like Raiders than the other sequels and Waller-Bridge services as Indy's sidekick well with a likable and engaging performance. But the emotional ending with Marion and Indy's reunion made this fan shed a tear or two as the iris wipe went to black. I was expecting to be disappointed but I was glad I was totally satisfied and beyond.,"Aug 30, 2023",audience_review
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Travis,"Not realistic when Indiana is shot in the upper left breast area and is able to pull someone up from a cargo bay, glider to earth and move around with ease. Indiana and Marion both looked VERY old, which they are. I liked the idea that Indiana was going to stay in 200 BC, but I also liked he made up with the wife. Not a bad movie but not the best of the series.","Aug 29, 2023",audience_review

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Senior Indy Fan,The action theme is way too far fetched and involved. Totally unrealistic for a man in his later years.

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Melanie K,"I loved the beginning sequence where Harrison Ford was back in the Nazi era. They made him look just like he did in the first movie. Great flashback!

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Susan,"What an exciting and appropriate finale to the Indiana Jones series! It has everything the Indy fan needs car chases, fights, despicable villains, and lots and lots of high energy action including bugs and eely snakes! Harrison Ford, who always seems angry at the world, actually gets a little sentimental in the scenes with you-know-who-who-invented-that-clock. I am not a fan of his love interest, and wasn't thrilled with the ending, but nobody asked me. It's probably best to include that story line. I give it 5 full stars with !!!!!.","Aug 24, 2023",audience_review

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Andrius B,"Let me start off this review with two points. First, I grew up watching all these films. I will always thank my dad for introducing this film franchise to me at the time that he did. That being said, I did go into this film with some nostalgia. second, I waited to see this film in the theater, so I already heard this film wasn't the best going into seeing it. Overall, this film was ok. Did we need a fifth Indiana Jones film? No. Could it have been better? Yes. Could it have been worse? Yes. Could they have gone woke at the end? Yes, and I'm happy they didn't. I'm happy they finished off Indiana Jones the way they did. What I have told others when they asked me my thought is this, this film lacks the ""spirit"" of Indiana Jones the other four films had. Is it worth seeing it in theaters? No. Is it worth watching on streaming when it comes out? Yes. Is it worth the rewatch? No.","Aug 20, 2023",audience_review

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Beagle,"Fun movie with some new (to the franchise) adventures (double chase scene, underwater, time travel) but filled with tired motifs (reconciliation with Marion, Nazis, redemption of child etc - I mean the reason they went with Russians in Crystal Skull was because the Nazis were worn out 20 years ago). A tad long at 2.5 hours. I think Harrison Ford has run his course as Indiana Jones. But it should have done better at the box office.","Aug 17, 2023",audience_review

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,PC,"I liked that it was like every other Indiana Jones movie, but also disliked that it was like every other Indiana Jones movie. Best part was that it showed (using AI) Harrison Ford as a young man, and as an old man, and how the body changes with that. Also thought the time warp part of the movie was very entertaining.","Aug 13, 2023",audience_review

I enjoyed The Young Indiana Jones, The Last Crusade, and some of the comic books that have come out over the years. I liked parts of Temple of Doom and even one or two moments of Crystal Skull (although most of that movie did not work for me). I would put Dial of Destiny ahead of Crystal Skull (for sure) and Temple too. It was a good send off for Indy, Marion, and Sallah. I liked the new characters as well and the story was interesting and fun.","Aug 12, 2023",audience_review

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Mike,"Entertaining, decent Indiana Jones fare. The ending left a bit to be desired, though, as usual. Needed to see IJ duking it out with the Romans on the battlefield instead of being knocked out by a punch from his female co-star, just to be dragged back on the plane bound (somehow?) for home. Overall, the pacing through the movie was a bit tedious at times, and a lot of lines fell flat. I guess one can never bring back those good old 1980s!","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Laurentius,"After checking the online reviews, I thought it would be a bomb, but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, the ending seemed contrived but it is after all wonderful fiction. The acting was top notch, the CGI effects were very good (even the de-aging process on Harrison and Mads), and the action was non-stop in 75% of the film. The remainder dwelled with introducing the new characters and locales and explaining the ""science"" and history essential to the plot. Far better than Crystal Skull and Temple of Doom. And I found Phoebe Waller a pleasant and refreshing addition who has taken some hard shots from reviewers for being a ""strong woman"", which was her role (can you say Sigourney Weaver) in the screenplay. Blame the writers, not her.","Aug 10, 2023",audience_review

Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Christopher K,"Indy is back with non-stop action, historical and exotic locales, and the Antikythera. Having just recently watched two television shows on the Antikythera mechanism itself, it was amazing to see it intricately woven into the plot of this movie. Plus, a surprise at the end that made my heart swell! My only issue with the movie, and its more of a mild irritation, is with the age regression. Harrison was pretty when he was younger, but he was never that pretty. And, in faraway shots, he still walked like an old man. Still, all in all, a great addition to the Indy franchise.","Aug 3, 2023",audience_review

Otherwise, the movie was great, except the chase scenes were too long.","Jul 25, 2023",audience_review
Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,Robert,"It had good moments but you could tell this was one of those movies shot, and re-shot over and over to the point the plot made no sense. The action was good but frankly this was just a long video game fetch quest where the bad guys magically teleport to where the good guys are for no logical reason, and where the newest characters are just unlikeable and down right insufferable at times...

The walk upstairs - arms by her side, one heavy step after another and the door closes...","Sep 8, 2023",audience_review
Past Lives,Lyn D,"Interesting ideas--particularly the idea that gives the movie its title. But it seemed like there was too much exposition and too many time jumps and not enough drama or characterization. It didn't quite follow through on delivering real conflict for the main character. However, while I found it not to completely deliver, I definitely was glad I saw it.","Sep 7, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,Mateusz M,"A stunning spectacle about childhood love and moving on in life Past Lives is a story of three characters–Nora (Greta Lee), Hae Sung (Teo Yoo) and Arthur (John Magaro). All of them are connected in a way somewhat familiar to the romance genre. Nora and Arthur are married, but their life drastically shakes upon the arrival of the former's childhood sweetheart, Hae Sung. The movie is a story of love long lost, but not forgotten. Nora seems to have moved on and built a life she always dreamt of. She's a scene writer in New York, happily married to Arthur, achieving her childhood dreams. Hae Sung lives in Seoul, being on the other end. He struggles in his personal life and career, but her spark for Nora keeps on living. Nora and Hae Sung reconnect 12 years after she left Seoul via Skype. At first, the chemistry is unmatched, and it builds towards a cozy and warm relationship, though, none of them can see each other in person. As time goes on and expectations meet harsh reality, they are forced to break contact. The internet connection starts to falter, some calls end up not being answered, being symbols of how both start to distance themselves from each other due to life kicking in. Unable to do anything, their tough-to-label relationship remains broken, until Hae Sung visits New York 12 years later. After his arrival, the two reconnect, much to Arthur's doubts about his and Nora's marriage that Hae Sung's visit lay upon them. Still, Nora and Hae Sung's chemistry is so unmatched, that viewers remain absorbed until the end. The movie's long pauses, awkward dialogues, and spectacular acting, especially from Greta Lee, make it all feel way too real–and too familiar as well. Director Celine Song secured her cinema debut with Past Lives, and it's an entry worth every applause. She created a movie with so much soul, though, it's no surprise given her past. Song herself found herself in a similar situation in the past, when her Korean childhood friend visited her while she was living in New York, married to her husband Justin Kuritzkes. And, I believe, it's also a situation and cobweb of feelings many of us found ourselves in our lives, which is why Past Lives punches you like a boxer in his prime. There have been many Noras, Hae Sungs, and Arthurs in our world. Nora and Hae Sung find themselves playing the same tune but on different strings. Hae Sung hasn't moved on with his life as much as he'd like to, being ""way too Korean,"" as Nora states. His love for Nora, or rather Na Young, which is what she was named in South Korea, is the reason he visited New York. Nora, on the other hand, seems to be over it, but the feelings are unburied once she and Hae Sung reconnect, despite Arthur's worries. Past Lives keeps it real. As much as we'd love for something major to happen, some things to be said, we–much like the movie's characters–are left in a blizzard of ambiguous feelings, without answers, finding it hard to keep ourselves together. It seems inappropriate to call Past Lives a love story. It's rather a tale of ""what ifs"" facing the unstoppable forces which are life itself. Would they be a perfect couple if Na Young hadn't left? Could it be changed if they had given themselves more patience in their online friendship? Everyone can answer these, but the answer will never be the same. The reason why Celine Song's entry to filmmaking is so effective and right to the bone is because its mirage story is a mirror. Everyone knows how to have their first love, and some have certainly experienced losing someone who they would call true love. Or, maybe, they found themselves in Nora or Arthur's seats. The complexity of love is a major reason is one of the main reasons behind its beauty and strength. Yet, as Past Lives showcases, it's not always as simple as it seems, even if we consider it to be perfect at some times. Song sucks us up to an incredibly slow but stunning journey. Carried by Lee's award-worthy performance, The Grizzly's duo (Christopher Bear, Daniel Rossen) ambient soundtrack, and detailed yet not overwhelming shots, it's a ride we don't want to end, even though it sometimes hits too close to the chest. When Nora and Hae Sung first meet after their 24-year-old parting, one of the first things Nora says to him is ""Woah."" These were also my first words upon leaving the theater, and cross my mind every time I think of Past Lives. By all means, Woah.","Sep 6, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,Wayne M,"Past Lives is a profoundly beautiful film. A serene and tender meditation on love, opportunities lost, regret and memory. An understated and yet powerful gem of a film. It's primarily set over three time periods, with the third period taking up the bulk of the film. We start over twenty years ago in Seoul as a young Hae Sung and Nora are good friends who develop a crush on each other. But just after their first innocent date Nora's parents emigrate to Canada. Fast forward a decade and Nora has moved to New York to become a writer, there she meets Arthur, a fellow writer. Hae Sung is still in Korea, studying. He tracks Nora down online and they start to communicate again after all those years passing. Then we move to the present day where Nora and Arthur are happily married in New York. Hae Sung comes to visit them and sees Nora in person for the first since they were children. Hae Sung has regrets in not following Nora earlier in their lives and wonders how their lives might have played out differently. This wistful and tender film is multi layered and nuanced. It shows expertly how relationships form and grow and how sometimes life turns out differently based upon decisions made. It's a quiet film and thankfully lacks artifice. Emotions are genuine but understated. The film speaks about the Korean concept of 'in-yeon', whereby people who meet in their current lives are also believed to have met in their past lives. This is a film about romance, but's not a romantic film. It's about human connections and how we communicate. Performances are just superb, especially Greta Lee and Teo Yoo in the lead roles. This film is one of the best of 2023 without a doubt.","Sep 6, 2023",audience_review
Past Lives,Edgar P,"A tale of innocent and platonic love of two individuals that shared a childhood but then grew-up apart only to meet again years later. The plot is quite simple and you feel you have already seen this kind of story being told, but what elevates Past Lives above other romantic dramas is its sensibility. Celine Song's directorial debut (she also wrote the screenplay) is handled in a way that's able to carry many delicate feelings and emotions. It almost makes the audiences wondering about a meta approach: ""what if… they have met before in their adult lives?"", ""what if… she has never leaved Seul?"" or ""what if she wasn't married already?"" – and that's proof about how compelling this narrative actually is. Past Lives also works beautifully thanks to a pair (or a trio) of fantastic acting performances from both Greta Lee and Teo Yoo. And while Lee's acting turn as a very down-to-earth, feminist and strong willed woman who's decided to conquer the world in her own way is a fascinating one and she carries the movie on her back, truth is Teo Yoo was the one who moved me the most with his soulful eyes and a heart full of hope. Lee got my attentions, but Yoo got my heart. In fact, I only felt the real emotional punch of the movie in the last scene, something I believe to be on purpose – Song presents us something that's very stoic on the surface, but then she uncovers all the feelings and heart underneath it. I was never bored, but at times I felt the movie to be underwhelming… then the third act almost got my heart crying. That was the moment I was able to understand that everything prepared the audience for that last scene. Past Lives grew a lot on me since the moment I watched it… and it still grows on me, to be honest.","Sep 5, 2023",audience_review

Nothing new is brought to the table, leading me to constantly, curiously, and fully-expectedly ask ""and then..?"", only to further be presented with nothing. ....

Past Lives,Mark L,"The acting, cinematography, and direction is top notch. This is a very simple story about lost love and connection. But it hits on something that most similar stories fail to recognize. How we feel about those relationships now and what we regret about how we failed to see it at the time. This is my favorite film of the year so far. The last 25 minutes is incredible.","Sep 4, 2023",audience_review
Past Lives,Ika B,"The atmosphere in this film is very pleasant and calm and peaceful. The depiction of the scenes is very well thought out and the connection between past and present is well depicted. The conplexity of feelings is addressed without condemning them. The main character's search for identity is also interesting. What if? A question that comes up often and that certainly has something to do with love, but basically has something to do with her identity. How did herself in the USA changed from her corean self? I found it very interesting to see how her ""two identities"" try to coexist, and her trying to understanding in what life she really belongs. At the end, when she is crying in her husbands arms, it's like she is letting go a part of what could've been her life and a part of her that felt comfortable, her initial self from her childhood.","Sep 4, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,Wayne K,"Beautifully written and deftly shot, Past Lives is a very self-assured debut for Celine Song, an acclaimed playwright that might have stuck to that medium, had the COVID pandemic not come along at the worst time for her. When you watch interviews with her, you can see how much of herself she's put into the film, which is just a few steps away from being a straight-up biographic. Rather than just being the kind of by-the-numbers romance we've seen a million times before, it's a rumination on the loves that didn't happen, and how they're not so easily put behind us. Our lead has a brief romance with a friend when they're both young, and then they move on with their lives, or do they? Most of the film is spent observing conversations between family and friends. Few things are outright stated, but questions and ideas are thrown out, and time is provided to think about it The film is in no hurry to rush from point to point. Sometimes it takes a little too long, and I certainly feel some issues could have been explored in more depth, but it does give you a fair bit to think about. It demonstrates how to include a scene from later on in the story at the beginning, a decision which not only doesn't spoil the plot, but also adds another layer of intrigue. It's a fine example of profundity in simplicity, managing to tell a compelling story with few characters and no real confrontations, arguments, misunderstandings or any of the other tropes that the romance genre has worn out over the years. If it proves anything at all, it's that Celine Song is a name to remember, and a filmmaker to watch out for.","Aug 31, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,Steve P,"Past Lives is an enthralling drama that delves into the intricacies of relationships and the choices we make. The story revolves around Nora (played by Greta Lee) and Hae Sung (portrayed by Teo Yoo) tracing their journey from childhood in South Korea to adulthood in the United States. As time goes by they reflect on the paths they've taken and the ones they've left behind. While the film's plot may appear simple at first its underlying themes run deep. It explores the emotions that accompany stages of relationships from childhood crushes to the uncertainties of adulthood. The narrative skillfully highlights how meaningful connections shape our lives while also confronting us with challenging realities. Past Lives presents a nuanced exploration of love, regret, and how our decisions ultimately shape who we become. The performances in Past Lives are truly extraordinary. Greta Lee and Teo Yoo deliver portrayals that authentically capture their characters' intricate emotions. Their on-screen chemistry is palpable creating interactions that deeply resonate. John Magaro also delivers an excellent performance as Arthur, Nora's writer husband. Under Celine Song's direction Past Lives creates an enchanting atmosphere filled with nostalgia and dream qualities that beautifully complement its essence. The cinematography showcases visuals of both New York City and South Korea. The movie's soundtrack is absolutely amazing creating a haunting and melancholic atmosphere that aligns perfectly with the movie's mood. Past Lives is a film that requires patience and attentiveness due to its pace. It may not appeal to everyone. Those who appreciate reflective storytelling will consider it essential viewing. It's the kind of movie that stays with you long after it ends, making you reflect on the choices you make in life. With its captivating exploration of love and regret Past Lives is a film that will resonate with anyone who has ever wondered about the paths not taken. In fact, it stands out as one of the best movies released this year.","Aug 30, 2023",audience_review

This film is one of those movies that's designed to make you feel. You've seen this picture before (whether it be the Before Trilogy, or the tamil film 96). But Past Lives does a great job of showing the human connection (and disconnection) that goes on in our lives, especially with certain individuals. Its a very amazing film, with incredible acting, directing, and writing. It takes its time to unravel and become the thing that it wants to be, but as it does so it beautifully, and poetically, shows what the human soul is made of: love.

Maybe because when I was 7 I had a friend who was my first male friend (not boyfriend though) who sat next to me in class and who did pranks with me. He was my soulmate. Maybe because at the end of the school year and ever since we were 8 I never so him again and I missed him for the last 21 years. Or maybe Celine Song just touched something in all of us. Something human. This film is that. Human. This exists to remind us of life and the people that come and go into our lives. Soulmates we got and lost. It's romantic and pure in the best way possible. It's not even necessarily sad, but it's heartbreaking in its way and by the end, I had eyes filled with tears. I wish Song and Lee Oscars. I mean it. I loved this film it's the best this year for me.

Past Lives,Ben L,"Here we are with another glacially paced, micro-budget, slice-of-life indie movie that's become a real side hustle for A24 in recent years among their cool stuff, to garner more award recognition from festivals and critics I guess? I smell Oscars for this one… I mean, hardly any of these make any money, that's for sure! They're not for commercial purposes and more about following the introspective characters talking about feelings than much of a plot. You just gotta feeel it man. Or something. Past Lives follows a duo that grew up together in South Korea before one of them moves away at age 12. They correspond a couple more times in adulthood many years apart to wallow a bit in what could have been before it peters out, as they had quite a bond as children I guess. We only saw a few short scenes of them as kids sitting or playing together though to illustrate this. Despite some interesting musings here and there, I found the writing a bit on the nose. There are various allusions to cultural identity, all pretty general and relatable on a human level. The performances are very good and natural of course, as that's the main point. The direction is above average with some striking imagery to be found. These kinds of movies are real hit and miss for me, and Past Lives is ultimately one of the better ones for sure; superior to the more dull stuff that's out there like Bling Ring, Roma, While We're Young, Song by Song, Knight of Cups, The Souvenir, Portrait of a Lady on Fire, Shiva Baby, and then in just the past year or two: Coda, Aftersun, Drive My Car, The Humans, and Showing Up that nearly all get ridiculously positive reviews somehow, many from this studio or Neon. I think it's funny that for how transgressive A24 and Neon's movies can be, they also like to put out these little indie dramas that hardly anyone but film buffs who spend too much time on the internet and critics will ever watch. And not a whole lot in between. I'm not a meathead Zack Snyder fan or anything though, I promise! Something like Past Lives is worth watching and certainly better than sitting through much of the unimaginative blockbuster dreck in theaters or Netflix, especially from these past few years.","Aug 24, 2023",audience_review
Past Lives,Excel A,"Past Lives This movie follows the reunion of two childhood friends two decades after one of them relocated. Celine Song in her feature directorial debut is keen and poignantly tells the bitter-sweet love story of its leads. The biggest praise of Past Lives is the cast. The chemistry between the leads is palpable, and their performances are well-nuanced. The plot is simple; it details love and loss. The female lead is poised about whether to continue with her comfortable but not exciting marriage or to walk down uncharted waters with a former childhood sweetheart. The ending shows that the decisions we make aren't always easy, and are sometimes riddled with regret that we think we may get over (even though that's not necessarily always the case). The movie also uses long bouts of silence that are as calming as they're frustrating and chilling. The cinematography is stunning and aided by an evocative score. In all, Past Lives is a brilliant and wistful romance flick. 8/10","Aug 24, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,Irfan Tommy N,"""Past Lives"" is one of those movies that will move you to tears not because of its story but because of what the story does to you. It makes you reflect on everything in your life, from your past choices and how it all led you to where you are now. The film invites and prompts us to think about our life journey and consider how our identity and lives would have been different if we had made different choices. We are a product of our decisions; in life, we can only make one of those before it leads to another. Before we know it, we will be treading a path entirely different from what we had in mind. Yes, this may all sound like one of those multiverse what-if themes we have seen all over Hollywood recently but trust me, this is different. Honestly, it's quite hard to tell you the beauty of the film, so I'd rather you see it for yourself and lose yourself in the film's spellbinding story. Celine Song's directorial debut ""Past Lives"" starts with three people sitting in a bar, drinking and chatting. We can't hear what they're saying, but we can hear other people's voices trying to guess the connections between the trio. Some said they were friends, some say tourists, and some said they had just met earlier. We don't know, but as the camera zooms into the lady sitting in the middle, she looks straight into our eyes - she knows, but she isn't going to tell us. The film then jumps 24 years into the past back to South Korea and introduces the children's version of the two Koreans we saw earlier - Na Young and Hae Sung. They were classmates and were each other's childhood crush before their friendship was cut short due to the girl's migration to Canada. During their final parents-supervised play date, Na Young's mother was asked why she was migrating, to which she answered, ""If you leave something behind, you gain something too."" From then on, the film jumps another 12 years, where Na Young has adopted an English name, Nora, and has just moved to New York City for college. She finds out that Hae Sung has been looking for her on Facebook, and before long, they're on Skype video calling each other, rekindling a lost friendship. But after a while, their revived friendship ends as Nora realises she is losing focus of her goals and falling for someone who exists merely behind a screen. The film then jumps another 12 years, where they physically meet in New York. Now, Nora is married to a man called Arthur. At the same time, Hae Sung has just gotten out of his relationship, and his arrival in New York sets off a love triangle. The duo finally meet for the first time and spend their day together, sightseeing and talking about their respective lives and what they have in common until it's clear that there is an underlying issue that has to be addressed. The film revolves around the Korean word and concept ""inyeon"", which means fate. Nora and Hae Sung spend their day together pondering their choices, decisions, and where they are now. Hae Sung asks Nora if they would be married if she had not moved. But he also wonders what Nora would have been if she didn't. For sure, Nora will still be Na Young. But then, altering the past would lead to some loss in the present. And thus, the film suggests to us to accept and not regret what is lost because that is what adulthood is all about, losing all of our past relationships. The film lightly touches on the immigrant experience, but that isn't the film's focus. The film occurs mostly across three days, and everything leads to the bar interaction we saw at the start. When revisited, the bar sequence shows us how much we and our relationships change as we grow older. The film may have started small, but gradually, it expands and becomes more than just a movie about two people longing for each other. It tackles adult relationships and cultural identity while also showing how a husband navigates his wife's reaction to her past colliding with her present. ""Past Lives"" is one of the best dramas I have seen this year, and I truly hope it gets to lay its hands on some nominations when awards season comes. Much talking, as expected from a film directed by a theatre playwright. Still, there are also extended pauses in between, hinting that what isn't there is as important as what is there. Director Celine Song directs the story with much care and does so sincerely and wholeheartedly that we are actually moved by the characters' plights. The trio cast are extraordinary in their roles, with each star offering a distinct perspective of this story. Greta Lee carries the film from start to end with her cheerful and playful embodiment of the young child she was, while Yoo Teo gives a splendid performance as a man who is still in love with the younger version of the woman in front of him, restraining his true emotions under a smile. While only appearing halfway through the film, John Magaro's tender apprehension gives the plot a source of light tension as Nora's husband. They will capture your attention and leave an indelible impression that lingers long after the credits roll. Back to what I said earlier, where I cried because of what the story does to me, the film haunts me existentially as I think deeply about how my future is dictated by my current choices. Every choice opens a door into the future, and choosing one means forgoing other doors we don't open and enter. And as we grow older and make more decisions, we leave behind an increasing number of closed, unopened doors. Doors that serve as an insight into the lives we might lead and people we might have been - and been with. But the film's concept of ‘inyeon', where brushing against one another could lead to a spark that may or may not lead to something more, whether you believe in that or not, suggests to us that our lives unfold within the space that lies between fate and our choices. After Hae Sung gets into his Uber and leaves, Nora cries and walks home to Arthur's arms. This film has made me question deeply about my relationship with those around me and implored me to properly consider the choices I make now so that I won't live a future of regrets. Each person who watches ""Past Lives"" will walk away with a different takeaway. It's a nuanced film that not only moves and entertains but also urges us to do some form of self-reflection and realise that we don't influence our lives. Our interactions with others do.","Aug 23, 2023",audience_review
Past Lives,N/A,"This movie reminded again why I love movies. Sometimes in this form of story telling, it can just get you to feel emotions for the characters created because it just resonates with you. Love isn’t definitive, it’s an ideal and timeless thing that anyone can relate too. What Celine Song has created with this film is something existentially personal and genuine. It’s something based in her life and the kind of care and raw emotions shows tenfold here. Since love transcends time and space, what happens when you’re in that grey area in your timeline where things don’t match with your current life? Celine Song explores her experience here. There is not true antagonist in the story besides life. It gets in the way of what we want to do sometimes even if we don’t notice it in true time. The 3 main characters are all people you want to root for and against at the same time, because we all have a stance on what we would do or not do if we were in any of their shoes. The acting and the scene framing are literally perfect. The pacing, the decisions to not use music on simple scenes such as walking down a city block, it all brings the feelings and you can feel it giving you goosebumps and stressing you out. You feel for the characters, everyone has different lives and beliefs, it all crescendos in the climax of the movie and you are right there with them at the very end, crying as well. I absolutely loved this movie, it showcases the beauty of life and storytelling to me. A romance film with out the romance and a love story that is necessary to be told for this generation.","Aug 22, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,Andrew S,"PAST LIVES explores a lifetime relationship between South Korean childhood friends who become separated due the girl's parents moving to the United States. Their parting is sudden and filled with unconscious disappointment. An ""angry breakup"" of sorts. As children, they shared a friendship that lightly teased at romance. At that young age, they don't understand how much they loved each other. As an adult, the woman has moved to New York City and is in college with a dream of becoming a writer. The woman, now in her twenties, remembers, and with the help of the very early Internet, reconnects with her ""lost love."" The two briefly reconnect in the Big Apple and come to understand how their paths changed their lives. They each question what could have been and will be in the future. The story caused me to recall lost friendships from my childhood. I spent two days deeply affected by this film and highly recommend.

Past Lives,Alan W,"Writer-director Celine Song's semi-autobiographically inspired debut feature is a romantic drama that gives me strong In the Mood for Love and Before Sunset vibes, which also happen to be two of my favourite films from the romance genre, even though technically this isn't as stylistically dense as the former, and the couple here have less providence or ""in-yeon"" than Jesse & Celine did in the latter trilogy. Essentially a film in 3 parts, childhood friends Nora and Hae-Sung are first introduced to us when they were 12-years-old in Seoul who are separated when her family immigrated to Canada. Revisiting them 12 years later in the second part, we find them reconnecting via Skype as Nora, now played by Greta Lee, is an aspiring writer in NYC while Teo Yoo's Hae-Sung remains in Korea studying engineering; and the final part takes another 12-year jump for another reunion over a single weekend. Spinning off this simple and effective narrative structure, Song has crafted an emotionally lush and beautifully nuanced film that feels grounded, engaging and breathtakingly romantic, without crossing into unwarranted (over)sentimentality. At the same time, it's always welcoming to see a snapshot portrait of the immigrant culture in America, especially from the under-represented Asian-American angle. While Song's penchant for artfully mounted slow pans infuses the film with a melancholic sense of longing, the central trio, which includes John Magaro's Arthur to complete the love triangle, in roles that require them to express, often non-verbally, internal conflicts and unspoken feelings, deliver quietly powerful and affecting performances that draw you in and tug hard at your heartstrings. A great calling card for Song and her wonderful cast, this is a bittersweet and captivating film that's so elegantly constructed, I find it an absolute joy to have discovered.","Jul 11, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,arvind s,"I have always believed the simplest stories make the best movies. That is why slice of life is my favourite genre & these movies come in all shapes and sizes. They can be about misplaced tiffin boxes, a constipated father or in this case about childhood friends meeting after a gap of 24 years. Celine Song's directorial debut is about Nora and Hae Sang, two friends living in Seoul. One day, Nora and her family move to Canada much to Hae Sang's dismay. 24 years later, they meet in New York. The title Past Lives is connected to the Korean concept of in-yeon (roughly translating to destiny). It is believed that all relationships (even the briefest of interactions that we have) are a part of our destiny. Expanding on an incident from her own life (read opening scene of the movie), Celine Song creates magic onscreen with minimal characters. Greta Lee, who plays Nora; Teo Yoo, who plays Nora's childhood friend, Hae Sung and John Magaro, Nora's husband. Though the focus is mostly on Nora & Hae Sung; on how they contemplate about the past and a what if scenario involving them; John Magaro's Arthur is important as he gives us the husband's perspective. Greta Lee & Teo Yoo will leave you spellbound with their grounded performances. Seoul & New York City play a prominent role in the story as well. Celine Song chose to narrate a very simple story about two childhood friends meeting up after 24 years in the most subtle way possible. There is a lot being said without it actually being said and that for me is a win (a big win). I loved every second of this gem and the proof is that I am still thinking about it even now.","Jul 9, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,Roberta,"I highly recommend the movie. It is marketed as a love story but there is no much more there. There are many threads worth following: It presents a powerful picture of loss and aches felt by immigrants. And a realization that even if you become well integrated into your adopted country, you may still dream at night in your native language. It also presents a powerful sense of a non-intentional refusal to relinquish childhood and its innocence. In that vein, I felt a very strong echo of The Great Gatsby while watching the movie. One cannot stand still with a fixed vision in one's heart while time marches on around you. The acting is superb. The actors achieve gritty, molecular-level communication through their eyes or a slight gesture. The cinematography is beautiful. It is worth a second viewing to catch the the sepia tones or the light reflecting off water as appropriate. The movie also uses very strong imagery. A teeny, tiny apartment with barely enough room to turn around to hold a stifled marriage. Hae Sung bogged down with his past and memories and dragging a heavy suitcase behind him, even up the stairs and into Tora/Arthur's apartment. The movie also does a great job at juxtaposing Hae Sung, alone in a sterile hotel room with Nora and Arthur cuddled together and sharing intimate conversation. What did not work as well, in my opinion, was the fractured timeline with 12 year intervals. The childhood scenes were obviously critical. But I am not sure how watching a line of soldiers marching and then sitting down and the camera panning across them while they ate added anything to the movie. The expressed sentiment that .Hae Sung and Nora were babies in school and perhaps even babies 12 years ago resonated. Not too sure about the implementation. All in all, it is a beautiful movie with multiple distinct messages.","Jul 9, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,Amal G,"'Past Lives' is an exploration of Ifs, Buts and Maybes. Rumination about the what could have beens that we can't seem to escape out of, and that which threatens to define our lives, if we let them. But memories are often funny. They are often unreliable, in no small part due to the unreliability of the narrator themselves. Myopic and clouded. We often tend to gravitate towards the extremes in our memories. : the good and the bad. And the mundane gets lost in translation and in time; by design, by nifty machinations or as collateral damage, I don't know. But it's like that office quote: ""There's a lot of beauty in ordinary things. Isn't that kind of the point? Then again, what would we rather let us passby. The ordinary or the extraordinary!

Past Lives,Judith K,"This is a wonderful debut movie! It's a well-told story about many subjects. First and foremost, about the power of an enduring childhood friendship/crush between a Korean boy and girl is that still powerfully felt by them when they meet up 24 years later in NYC. It's also about developing a new identity as an immigrant while retaining ties to a long-time friend and one's original cultural traditions and language. And it's about appreciating life's possibilities in different settings and visualizing the different destinies one could have, and how one chooses and settles on a particular life option. It's beautifully written and filmed, and very well acted. This is a movie I will think and muse about for a while!","Jul 8, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,Brendan L,"Not a dry eye when I left the theater. This film is packed with heart aching themes such as race, long-distance love, loneliness and just growing up in general. A movie has never felt so real and authentic to me in such a long time. The silence in some scenes resulted in the audience depicting pure body language from the characters which was such a cool thing to decipher, just like the characters were doing in real time. The film truly puts you in their shoes and keeps you on your toes throughout.  John Magaro's character felt very out of place and just a complete waste of a character, but that seemed to kind of be the point. Wonderful choosing of soothing melodies, an intrinsic chemistry and such complete cinematography are only part of the reason why this film should be on your To-Do list and certainly keep a look out for more from Celine Song !","Jul 8, 2023",audience_review
Past Lives,Jenapher Z,"I feel like one of very few people who thought this film fell absolutely flat. Despite having incredible performances, the narrative does nothing to elevate a rather simple concept beyond face value. More importantly, the protagonists have no palpable chemistry or romantic spark, and in particular, Greta Lee's character seems ambivalent most of the time. There is a portion where the protagonists exchange that they feel it's interesting to speak to each other… and yet nothing interesting has been said. All dialogue between the protagonists feels hollow and trivial. The film ends on a touching shot that ultimately feels unearned. My friends and I got the sense that the narrative was constrained by perhaps the writer's own experience, as it feels very much based on real life- and upon researching it, that's exactly what happened. The film feels flat because it prioritizes telling the director's own story rather than telling the most compelling cinematic story. Sincerely feel that Past Lives was overblown with praise, and that I know plenty of real-life stories that could contend and surpass what was portrayed here.","Jul 7, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,Sheldon B,"This film is one of the best drama—romance films I've seen in quite a while. I thought the silence was so appropriate and made the film so watchable. Each character seems perplexed. Both Hae Sung and Nora make mistakes. He fails to acknowledge her Seoul visit and she in my opinion treats him terribly by telling him while they are Skyping it will be a short while and they will be back to communication. She doesn't live up to this and in effect lies to him. It's heart-breaking since she goes on to find a husband who it seems was more for convenience than an actual ‘real' partner. You wonder how much growth there has been in their relationship. Maybe, just maybe, Hae Sung caught a break. Nora doesn't come across as a person who has it together and maybe never has. Overall it's great drama without all the usual blathering. It's a 9 out of 10 for me.","Jul 6, 2023",audience_review

Past Lives,Mark H,"Writer/Director Celine Song has used her own life story to craft 2023's best film so far. Nora is twelve years old and has a crush on her classmate Hae Song. Unfortunately for the burgeoning romance, Nora's parents have decided to leave Seoul and immigrate to Canada. Twelve years later, Nora and Hae Song reconnect through the miracle of social media. Their relationship becomes a series of video calls where the sense of connection is palpable. Eventually though, Nora decides that they should stop talking for a while; she wants to focus on career opportunities in her new home town of New York City. Another twelve years later, Hae Song decides to vacation in New York City. It's an opportunity for him to see a now-married Nora face-to-face for the first time in twenty-four years. It's all sweet, sad and thoughtful. In the process, this film offers more observations about the human condition than any film in recent memory. Several elements make this film outstanding. The cast is pitch perfect. As the adult Nora, Greta Lee (""The Morning Show,"" ""Russian Doll,"" Will Aronson's musical ""My Scary Girl"") is mesmerizing. She blends her well-honed comic timing with a sincerity and vulnerability that are irresistible. As Hae Song, Teo Yoo (""Leto,"" ""Decision to Leave"") is equally impressive. You can often read his emotions without a word having to be spoken. John Magaro (""The Big Short,"" ""First Cow"") has a smaller but still essential role as Nora's husband, Arthur. In one of the best film scenes in recent memory, Nora and Hae Song are in a bar speaking in animated Korean while Arthur sits patiently, uncomfortably beside her. Clearly, this is a film that could have gone in a million different directions. Song deftly uses her story to explore a variety of themes – the nature of relationships, the immigrant experience, the necessary balance between work and relationships, the role of fate (and the Korean concept of ""in-yun""). She does it all in an unhurried style that makes ""Past Lives"" feel similar to Richard Linklater's ""Before"" trilogy. It's my guess this film will be equally well-loved and critically regarded. What's most surprising here is Song's self-confidence as a first-time filmmaker, given that she has the additional responsibility of being true to her own story. Many of the story elements of ""Past Lives"" are autobiographical. Song emigrated from Korea to Canada at age 12. She, like Nora, is a playwright. She currently lives in New York City with a husband she met on a writer's retreat, like her character. Realizing and respecting the power of her story, Song infuses this film with an unhurried pace that allows real emotions to develop and well-earned insights to come to the surface. Song has the self-confidence to highlight the power of words left unspoken. She uses her technique to convey the insurmountable gulf between two characters who, paradoxically, are standing two feet apart. Like many of the best films, ""Past Lives"" will serve as an incentive for self-reflection for many moviegoers. You'll leave the theater pondering the arc of your own story and the crucial ""what-ifs"" that have affected your own journey. ""Past Lives"" is a powerful, evocative experience for any moviegoer with a beating heart.","Jul 6, 2023",audience_review
Past Lives,Edison S,"This is the best movie I've seen this year and #1, it's not even close and #2, I watch darn near everything cause I love going to the movies. I go to the movies ALL the time and this is the best thing I've seen since The Whale. A movie with depth and substance is obviously the most rare thing nowadays but I can honestly say I've never seen a movie like this. This is THEE most subtly impactful movie I've ever seen. It glides along so smoothly and the underlying subject matter is about a subject almost no movies exhibit, longing. Longing is by far one of the worst and most helpless feelings ever if you've ever experienced it and this movie does a fantastic job of portraying that. If you've ever felt love, go see this movie.","Jul 6, 2023",audience_review

A very simple yet powerful story, exceptional performances by the actors and an intense emotional journey fills your heart to the brim.

The complexity and intricacies of the modern day relationships are such beautifully explored that it makes your gut hurt at times and let your tears heal that pain at others.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,Brian Tallerico,"“Mutant Mayhem” is a pretty shallow venture thematically.

The story held our attention until the very endeven the extra clip during the credits. To be honest the adults were all kind of annoyed that the kids really wanted to see the TMNT movie, but we had no idea the writers, producers, and cast were all some of our favorites!

The Turtles have never sounded better (especially considering that they've never been cast this young before). The music and soundtrack were also great and this is pretty much as good as it gets when it comes to the TMNT IP. If you're a fan at all of TMNT, this movie is a must watch.","Aug 28, 2023",audience_review
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,Google,"We watched it in 3d and it wasnt exhilarating. Good music and cast. The writing, storyline and action all seemed great as well.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,Jason76,"Great as a new story, but as a life long fan I just wish the training origins of Master Splinter came from his master in Japan vs learning his craft from watching YouTube and Shaolin flixslol! Funny tho! That was a weed moment in writing from Seth and crew! And the only other thing voice wise was in my opinion I wish Donnies voice over actor should have been Mikeys voice and vice versa.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,CDubs,"Not really a movie for kids. There is a lot of swearing. There is not enough action, but the action that is present is - in my opinion - too violent for a kids' movie. The turtles are not the the turtles of old. They are just electronics-addicted teenagers in turtle bodies who steal groceries. It felt like the character development was lacking. Donatello is no longer a technologically smart turtle, but a video game nerd. Splinter is an old rat who used YouTube to teach martial arts - no longer a trainer of insight, self-control, integrity. It was disappointing.","Aug 28, 2023",audience_review

Plus, it was non-stop action and the 90+ minute runtime was perfect! Back to animation that was a good length for kids with enough references and quips to keep the adults entertained too. Kids raved about it and so do I!","Aug 28, 2023",audience_review
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,Evilmanta,"The movie was funny, action packed, and heartfelt at times. I like that the turtles are ACTUALLY teenagers in this version.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,Satyendra,"For National Cinema day, I decided to go and watch this retelling of the classic mutant story. Is it as good as the 1990 film? No. Is it better than the 2014 reboot? Yes. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem is a film with a lot of heart and made by people who are clearly fans of the franchise. This is a film that I think best displays the relationship between the four turtles especially with them being teenagers. The choice of having actual age-appropriate voice actors for the role I think was what made this film incredibly good especially in its humor. If you love The source material whether that be the cartoon or the original comics or if you're just a fan of these kinds of movies then I highly recommend it.","Aug 28, 2023",audience_review

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,Cineman,"I grew up loving the TMNT and have tried to keep up with its different incarnations. I feel the franchise has adapted yet again, for a whole new generation. The animation of this new iteration of the turtles is very refreshing, Im happy to see more mutants from the 80s cartoon being featured. The Michael Bay TMNT movies left a bad taste for the ninja teenagers in my opinion, this has placed the franchise in a better light for the future of the Turtles.","Aug 28, 2023",audience_review

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem,Brian M,"I was immediately critical of the previews, particularly due to the Turtles' youthful voices. But across 100+ minutes of movie they don't come off as annoying as I feared. The art style is very good. It's gritty and has a tone reminiscent of TMNT comics. The animation, while derivative of the Spider-verse films, allows the Turtles to perform physical feats unachievable by stuntmen in costumes or even the bigger, bulkier CG Turtles we've seen in the Michael Bay films. That being said, some action sequences are a bit jittery and the editing makes some of the combat hard to follow. The humor is decent, though laden with references to modern pop culture, which can be lost on older audiences like myself. But the Turtles of my youth did the same thing, so fair is fair. The story is good, providing a sufficient amount of tension and genuine sentiment, which is another thing the original TMNT film did so well. I'm not a fan of the concept of the Ninja Turtles pursuing their ambitions to acclimate themselves to human society and be accepted. I feel like there's a certain element of tragedy that gets lost if they were to ever achieve that goal. A concept even the slightly underrated TMNT: Out of the Shadows tinkered with, but didn't pursue too strongly. Batman is forever tortured by his parents' murders, Spider-Man is poor and unpopular, and the Ninja Turtles are outcasts who selflessly save a world they can never be a part of. You can change a lot about the Turtles without compromising their identities and the morals and conflicts of the source material, but within reason. Again, the Turtles' voices aren't as bad as I originally thought, but I appreciate the rest of the cast. Ice Cube, Jackie Chan, John Cena, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogan... Star-studded casts are often a sign of a weak animated film, but they all turn in good performances, though I feel some of them don't get enough lines to justify their being cast in the film. There were only a few instances when I had trouble discerning some of the dialog either due to messy audio editing during scenes with loud music or sound effects or too many characters rambling all at once. Despite my original reservations, I would not be opposed to seeing a sequel to this film provided the story doesn't go in directions I fear it could. But if you're like me and you put off seeing it because you didn't like what you saw in the trailers, you might consider giving it a chance and judging it by the sum of it's parts. You just might be pleasantly surprised.","Aug 28, 2023",audience_review

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,Benny C,"Have to admit that I didn't finish this movie, I tried, but it just seemed to get dumber and dumber, and filled w/weak a$$ thoughtlessness up to, at least, the point I had enough; and, long story short, that point was one of the girls reminiscing good ol' times when her BFF queefed on one of their subservient friends (visual flashback). If you are expecting Sandler as part of this, well, he's pretty much dormant up to that point, and it's hard to imagine this picking up for any kind of recovery. The whole thing isn't even worth a hail mary, but if you wanna start watching it, and see what I'm talking about, maybe skip to the queef and go on from there (critics unbelievably give this 90% rating???). The jokes are lazy, and akin to a broken record. If this is 90%, this world is filled w/simple minds.","Sep 9, 2023",audience_review

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,N/A,"Some of these hater reviews on here make no sense. Do people really just go into such a movie with no clue whatsoever about what it actually is other than it’s a “Sandler flick”? It was very clear from all trailers/marketing that this was a teen, coming of age film - i.e. not a typical silly Sandler comedy with all his buddies - and obviously a blatant star-making vehicle for Sandler’s daughter. He was intentionally a side character so as to let others (mainly his daughters) shine. Duh. Not saying y’all should love or even like the film, but it’s pretty dumb to go into a movie assuming and expecting something that is completely different from what the film is, and was very straightforward about what it would be, from the get-go. As for the film itself, it was cute and an easy watch…Sandler’s daughter was actually much better than I thought she would be - ya know, nepo babies & all, it’s not like she truly earned such a starring role if we’re being honest…but she may have some legit acting potential, we’ll see. Random side note: anyone else kinda feel like the actor who played the boy she has a crush on was told to watch ‘Euphoria’ and channel a PG version of Fezco? 😆 (RIP Angus Cloud) But anyway…most importantly, I knew what I was getting myself into watching this movie and therefore set expectations accordingly!","Sep 3, 2023",audience_review

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,Charles G,"The movie was neither good nor bad, it was average. (Sunny's acting was surprisingly better than anyone else in the film.) The plot was average and predictable, and most of the other character's acting was sub-par. Adam Sandler and Sunny were basically the only ones delivering. But the atmosphere and dialogue was good- not so much ""laugh out loud funny"", as it showed you what a functional family and society could and should be like and they had some interesting set-pieces... a beautiful lake to cliff-dive at, a well decorated room, bat mitzvahs, and the school were all interesting. Let's talk about what everyone's really thinking: ""Wow, Jewish people seem to be really rich, well connected, and have amazing parties!"" Yeah, they do. Some people might find that to be a bad thing… but I don't. There's nothing wrong with being successful, popular, or having a good life. Here's my question: Since they're so rich, popular, and sociable… why does the Jewish community seem so focused on attacking whites, though? Just a genuine question. We aren't a threat to their community. We're earning 50% less income than them. Why can't they just be happy with their place at the top, without needing to try and destroy us in the media? A lot of Jewish people seem to think whites dislike them, but we honestly don't. A lot of us admire or envy Jewish people but it's in a good way. The only reason some whites get defensive is because they feel like Jewish people are using media, news, schools, CEO positions, etc, to attack them basically. It doesn't need to be that way- does it? Perhaps if everyone got along and respected other cultures and other groups, (whites and Jewish people both), including in the media, then society would be more harmonious.","Sep 3, 2023",audience_review

The acting for the main characters was fine, and I didn't even realize the girls were Adam Sandler's daughters till I saw the credits.

Critics can only have seen a different movie and given their opinion, on top of that there were some who said that it's rare to see a movie where they put friends above crushes, if I turn on my Television i will find several identical films that manage to at least make me laugh.

But this seems like an entitled peice of shit that I turned off after 20 minutes because there was nothing relatable. I count on Adam to be able to relate to the underdog in some way and this movie has nothing to accomplish that. However, I'll remain a fan of his forever... we cannot hit home runs all of the time.","Sep 2, 2023",audience_review

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,Adrian D,"This was an at times painfully bad movie to watch. I actually squirmed the first hour it was so bad, then cried at the end because the ending was so good. My wife and daughter (20 something) hated it. I thought it was stupidly inappropriate -- for no good reason. Why show a bloody maxi-pad? Why show a teen girl ""queefing"" on the face of a sleeping girl? That is sexual assault and added 0.0% to the movie. Then the movie shows the supposed 7th grader in very sexual clothes and poses, again adding nothing to the plot but taking a lot away from the enjoyment. Other than that, it had its good moments. Getting 96% positive was a shock -- I was expecting 20%. Definitely would never watch again or recommend anyone watching it.","Sep 2, 2023",audience_review

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,Jonathan G,"Since they (netflix) talked about this movie I had accompanied the development and news about it, and I was kinda hyped for. I liked, more than I thought I would, I usually like coming of age movies, and this had some problems. Like the stereotypical about a 13y old girl, man, it was like ""What 13y old girls like? Oh yeah, put somethings about Taylor Swift, Ariana grande and Olivia Rodrigo."" Just didn't had anything special on the character. They try put some things related to the LGBT, and sucks (the way they put). Like, 13y old girls saying that they aren't straight, man, just why put that? But overall I liked, I think they kind of inspired on euphoria, cause of some takes and things like, to record they messaging and stuff on the phone and clothes. The acting was good, very good, and the plot surprising made some sense, what don't usually happens.","Sep 1, 2023",audience_review

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,Live M,"To start , I am a fan of Adam Sandler. I even was an extra on his movie Hustle ( which he promised to talk to me twice but blew me off ). I get introducing his 2 daughters to the movie business. You always want to do stuff for your family. This movie that got a 97% rating approval on Rotten Apples. My question is - How ? It's a cutesy teen movie about the coming of age to adult. These are young actors so performances are mediocre at best. The constant loud music over dialogue the entire movie was completely annoying. I think they incorporated catchy music to make the viewer forget about any scene. We had to turn on ""captions"" because every scene had loud music. It was brutal trying to follow the dialogue. Everything was predictable but these kids did get a nice introduction to Hollywood. Again , I am a fan of Adam Sandler and his family but not this movie. It was nice to see Adam not have his normal 4-6 friend actors in this movie like he always does......which most of the time I'm okay with. It is a nice loyalty thing Adam does.","Sep 1, 2023",audience_review

Debí admitir aquí Adam sandler no está tan sobreactuado y eso se agradece y bueno tampoco es que aporte mucho además de ser una caricatura de un fanático religioso. Esta película es protagonizada que por la hija menor de sandlerny dios que mala actriz es todo el tiempo tiene cara de una especie de Merlina y pues no le veo mucho futuro en la actuación . Para terminar el humor no es más que una retsila de chistes poco graciosos y depena ajena en una película que supongo trataba de romper esquemas pero no llega a ser ni mordaz ni sarcástica sino un cliché tras cliché C: 6.5/10","Sep 1, 2023",audience_review

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,Ranny L,"I really enjoyed watching You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah and felt very connected with it for so many reasons. I definitely feel that, regardless of one's religious beliefs you can find a way to relate to this film, which I especially love. The story is very well written and I love the way this film was shot. The storyline is about a 12-year-old girl, Stacy, who has been planning her bat mitzvah since she is turning 13. So was her best friend Lydia and they both planned on helping each other for their big day which meant everything for them. Stacy has a big crush on Andy, a boy who goes to the girls' school. But things take a turn when boys start interfering with the girls' personal lives and friendship. I strongly believe this film is very relatable for many viewers, especially teens. I saw myself experiencing many things that are similar to what Stacy and Lydia deal with in this film. The script is very influenced by Gen Z in the best way possible. The dialogue feels very natural and not at all forced. One of my biggest pet peeves with teen films is when the dialogue tries to sound like a ""cool teen"" might, when in reality it comes off as cheesy. The entire film feels very natural to me in that it doesn't feel like a cliché high school style of film. I really like the score of this film, the overall acting, and the script -- all of that combined really captivated me. Kudos to director Sammi Cohen whose direction is very on the ball with this film. Sunny Sandler's portrayal of Stacy is so relatable; I love Sunny's acting style. Samantha Lorraine's characterization of Lydia works so well with showing her friendship with Sunny - it feels like they've been best friends for years. I also loved Sadie Sandler's portrayal of Ronnie, Stacy's older sister. Her character is so uniquely different from Stacy; I love the dynamic between them and the contrast of their characters. Dylan Hoffman's Andy is the perfect representation of teenage boys nowadays which Dylan executes so well. Last, Sarah Sherman's portrayal of Rabbi Rebecca really stands out -- she is one of my favorite characters because of her distinctive characterization. Although I am not Jewish, that didn't interfere with how I connected with this film in the slightest. I think the message of this film is that even when one's intentions aren't bad you can still hurt someone else. I give You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, plus adults. It is available on Netflix beginning August 25, 2023.

Sunny Sandler, though not a stranger to movie sets, carried herself like a seasoned actress, she was fantastic. Sadie had a smaller part but was spot on as well.

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,C.L. W,"Blah! It's just blah. There was much hype but ""You Are So Not Invited To My Bat Mitzvah"" is not worth it. If they haven't paid for praise then I'm forced to distrust the general public. Critics are a peculiarly focused lot anyway. It's not an interesting or particularly new story. Mild cultural obligation and safe adolescent angst behind shrill family foibles. It's just a mediocre kid with mediocre problems. It's not funny. It's not poignant. It's not clever. There's one scene that builds and creates some emotion, but it's not the resolution of the film, so after that brief bit of craft, there's just more blah, slightly high stress intoned blah for not very high stress situations. There are some poor parenting choices to shout out if you enjoy that, but I found their mundane empathy deficiency and inability to listen alienating. So many parenting faux pas in films could be solved with a teentsy percent of shutting up and letting a kid speak that they create a collective volume of banal dysfunction that grates en masse. But the film scores nothing on importance or insight, so alienation isn't a negative quality to lend it any power. Forgettable nothingness. Fill your time with something more interesting. This is just filler. Required a cleanser viewing of something smarter afterwards because it had a similar effect to an uncomfortable gathering, like the wedding of a 2nd cousin where some thrice-removed in-law has a meltdown about teal.

This movie is definitely safe for the tween crowd, and unless you're Amish, I doubt you'll find yourself covering the eyes and ears of your kids while watching this one. If you're viewing solely for typical Adam Sandler schtick, you'll be disappointed; he rightfully takes a back seat to his daughters in this film.

The connection with his daughters truly comes through on screen and makes some of the scenes feel very authentic. I also became interested in finding out who the actors were after I saw the movie because of his connection with a female character that wasn't his wife in the movie. My first thought was ""oh, no! I hope they don't wreck the movie with him cheating on his wife"", but nope that's just his real life wife and their chemistry is that electric. I'd watch the movie again.","Aug 30, 2023",audience_review

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,Justin A,I cannot believe how highly rated this movie is. I turned it on after turning off the movie where Zoey Deschanel threw her cat in the Hudson River because I needed something light and honestly anything is better than that... well I was wrong. Everytime I almost turned this movie off I thought about that kitten in a duffle bag and that kept me tuned in but that was a mistake. The only redeeming quality was the stealie on the top of rabbi Rebecca's yalmaka but that wasn't enough to save this insufferable drivel. I should have just kept watching the other movie to see if Zooey Deschanel ever got a cat that didn't have cancer. You're all sheep!,"Aug 30, 2023",audience_review

You Are So Not Invited to My Bat Mitzvah,Carly K,I'm a Religious School Teacher for this age group and I felt like the film really captured what teens are going through at this age. The actors were so great at portraying the complexity of being a teen in the cell phone / social media age. Some of the classroom scenes were a bit cringy and the Rabbi was a characature of what younger rabbis are like but I think Jewish teens and adults will find some familiarity and humor in those scenes. You don have to be Jewish though to enjoy this film. Really cute movie and superb acting by all.,"Aug 30, 2023",audience_review

I know of this case but was not prepared for some of the revelations showcased in the documentary, in a good way. The doc holds your attention very well for the slightly over 90 minute runtime. This may change the way you think about haunted objects, and the focus on magical and ritual practices is a breath of fresh air and very needed.

The essence of this movie will bring you to tears, the care these people have put into not just this film but into the Crone and all of their haunted objects shows just how important it is for all of us to not just act out of fear but out of respect for the unknown is profound.","Sep 8, 2023",audience_review

The Unbinding,Kyle W,"The Unbinding is a lovingly crafted (and spooky!) documentary from the wonderful folks at Planet Weird. The film centers on ""the crone"" - a carved figure found within a cave in the Catskill mountains of NY that later makes its way to the Newkirk Museum of the Paranormal - and the terrifying anomalous events left in her wake. While watching you may think you know where the story is going, but the second act takes a turn that will lead you to question your beliefs on the nature of the paranormal and how we interact with it. The care taken by director Karl Pfeiffer adds to the already fascinating story to create what can only be described as a love letter to the genre. Truly outstanding! This is a film that will both stick with and challenge you in ways you will not expect. I highly recommend The Unbinding for anyone with an interest in exploring the unknown.","Sep 8, 2023",audience_review
The Unbinding,Toni K,This Documentary is an example of a beautifully visual and intimate journey into a real paranormal research of high strangeness and things of this world we don't understand.

Diverging from tired and juvenile tropes that you usually see in paranormal television, the team approaches the phenomena with compassion, intellectual curiosity, and a genuine desire to leave their corner of the world better than they found it.

Sitting in Bars with Cake,Fletcher Peters,"The film follows a pair of friends who bring a new, mouth-watering cake to different bars every time they go out... But this charming movie is more unforgettable than your run-of-the-mill party with cake.","Sep 7, 2023",critic_review

Sitting in Bars with Cake,Gemma L,"This movie is so wonderful, it's tender, funny and tackles something really hard and sad in a wonderful way.

Good Boy,Miyako Pleines,"The first two thirds of the film built up the potential for an ending that both shocks and satisfies its audience, but we get the easy way out.

I just hope besides the predators themselves every single executive of BSA that existed before their bankruptcy has been purged from the org.

Beyond the Grave,Ranny L,"Beyond the Grave is one of the most informative and awakening documentaries I have ever watched! The whole concept of it is alluring because who wouldn't want to learn about what happens in the afterlife. I also enjoy it because of how everything is so clearly explained. The documentary covers lots of spiritual discoveries and intriguing stories. It is also amusing to watch if you are interested in paranormal activity. The plot of Beyond the Grave follows Serena DC who is on a mission to figure out as much as she can about what happens after you die. She travels around meeting with different experts, doctors, mediums, and even paranormal investigators who all have stories to disclose. Throughout her trips Serena attains new knowledge that she is using to answer the main question of what really happens to one's soul after they pass and other factors that involve their life before death. Beyond the Grave has loads of information and each piece adds a bit to the puzzle. The main reason Serena interviews all of these people is because the majority of them share at least one thing, which is the fact that they faced death head on in their own way. For the ones who didn't, they are professionals when it comes to life and death situations. One of the people she meets whose narrative touched me was Susana Grau. She gained abilities after her near-death experience to the point that she can communicate with present spirits. She gave Ms. DC some really interesting information. Another interesting person is Ellen Whealton, who witnessed things out of earth's reach that changed her life for the better and made her who she is today. Each of the people Serena talks with explain their stories and how they changed their lives. The documentary is very well executed from the camera work to the interviews. The film's message is to show and prove that death, the one assured thing in life, may sound scary but it could truly be just the beginning of something unimaginable to the human mind and its analysis should be seen as such. I give Beyond the Grave 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 13 to 18, plus adults. Beyond the Grave releases September 5, 2023, on VOD!

The Hanged Girl,Rich Cross,"No one’s character journey makes sense, and none of the script’s wider themes is developed, so they end up being left (in an oddly fitting way) hanging.","Aug 30, 2023",critic_review
The Hanged Girl,Tyler B,"At the end of the day, I sit here disappointed. The beginning of the movie showed definite promise but it waited so long that whatever interest I had dissipated away. Most of the movie seemed to be more of a character drama as opposed to an actual horror movie. Although the twist is effective, I think that the original title would have better served the movie. When the ending came, I was grateful that something scary was actually happening but was disappointed because it hadn't done the leg work needed for satisfying payoffs. My feelings are simply ""Meh""","Sep 8, 2023",audience_review
Thirst,Anteupt N,"This movie was a slow, boring, drawn out, rip off of several other much better movies. The storyline had zero original concepts and the acting was just bad.

Sirona,Chandler S,"If you're looking for that breath of fresh air that combines amazing acting, a storyline worthy of its own franchise, and a production value that far exceeds the associated ""independent"" title, then Sirona is the movie to watch.

There's absolutely no reason to miss this.","Sep 8, 2023",audience_review
Sirona,Chris H,"Sirona is a blast! The film hooks you from the very beginning and doesn't let up until the end end credits roll. For a new director Wesley Clark does an outstanding job of unfolding a very cool and often intense story with several twists and turns. The action scenes are very well executed, especially the fight scenes. The characters are well developed and all unique in their own way (Tuck is the man!!!). The fact that it takes place in Colorado and was actually filmed in Colorado makes it legit and gives the film a real feeling of authenticity.

For a small indie film this is very impressive. It starts out extremely gripping and makes you want to keep watching. The acting is pretty stiff with some exceptions, but it's passable. I loved the Julie character (I'm biased being a female) and I think I'm in love with whoever the actor is who played Sirona's brother at the beginning…so is my daughter 🤣🤣 All things considered I enjoyed watching and recommend for a fun date night movie! Woohoo Colorado!😆","Sep 7, 2023",audience_review
Sirona,Steven S,"Sirona is an independent sci-fi/thriller feature film produced by a small group of friends in Colorado. The film has a ton of heart that shows throughout. You can really see the passion these filmmakers had for the film from beginning to end. For having such a small budget with no corporate backing, this film came out with some pretty insane quality and cinematics. Highly recommend for anyone trying to stay in and have a nice movie night while supporting small-budget independent films. I would love to see a sequel, maybe even a third part, to the growing Sirona franchise. By the end of the film, I felt like I knew these characters and became friends with them.

Shane Gillis: Beautiful Dogs,Jay P,"Gillis's YouTube special remains the gold standard of what this comic can do, and nothing that shows up here reaches the heights of some of his ""Secret Podcast"" jags, but ""Beautiful Dogs"" is nonetheless a fantastic introduction for new fans as to exactly what people love (and love to hate) about Shane Gillis. Enthusiastic but wry, Gillis has an infectiously affable delivery that's equal parts self-effacing and savage. His real trick seems to be that he doesn't care, or at least gives off the air that he doesn't seem to -- in an era when most comedians seem to care far too much, Gillis has mastered the art of comedic distance, and it pays off in some classic bits. Hope this isn't the last we see of him on Netflix, I re-subscribed just to watch this.","Sep 7, 2023",audience_review
Shane Gillis: Beautiful Dogs,zac c,The Dawgs are rejoicing after this one! I watched this and said wow what a great special. But really this is the best comedy special in a long time. Shane gillis is the king of comedy right now. He can do no wrong.,"Sep 7, 2023",audience_review
Shane Gillis: Beautiful Dogs,Anthony P,"I'm a genuine fan of Shane. His podcast can be pretty good at times. I think in the first special on YouTube, he took his time in setting up jokes, punch lines, and scenarios. He was very diligent about using logic and misdirection well. I thought his first comedy special was extremely funny. I saw him perform some of this content live, and he was a knock out. However, this special felt very underdeveloped to me. I noticed the special was about 52 minutes long. If Shane spent another ten minutes instilling further details, context, and set up to all of his jokes, I think this would've been a way stronger special. Watch Louie C.K., David Chappele, Iliza Schlesinger, or Taylor Tomlinson or other top-notch comedians that can provide further context and introspection for each of their jokes.","Sep 7, 2023",audience_review

No. We do not use language such as the ""R-word."" Nope. Nope. Nope. I did giggle at a joke within the first four minutes, though. Can't recall which one. It definitely wasn't the ""all the other countries suck -- america is the best"" joke, though.

I've watched it on repeat 3 times now and only stopped to rate this 5 stars on IMDB. I truly hope this will be remembered as the Special of the year. And it really reminds me of Carlin and Louis. It almost makes me emotional. Plus I know the big Kahuna is going to read this and I want him to feel extremely gay for taking this praise and acknowledgment. Go watch this.

Strays,Richard Crouse,"It is a safe bet to call Strays the most adorable, yet rudest movie of the year. Reggie and his pals are a cute canine quartet but the film’s “beyond the chain” jokes and situations, mostly involving poop, vomit and doggie sex, are anything but sweet.","Aug 17, 2023",critic_review
Strays,Neal Pollack,"But between the cushions of its couch-humping jokes, Strays has at least a vaguely moral center. The movie, for all its juvenile ""what if we actually showed Lady and the Tramp doing it"" energy, is strongly against animal abuse.","Aug 17, 2023",critic_review

Strays,Nick Schager,"“Any grown-up’s desire for such material will be swiftly neutered by [the film], which despite boasting the participation of genuinely funny people like Will Ferrell, Jaime Foxx, Isla Fisher, and Randall Park is a mirthless mutt of a movie.”","Aug 17, 2023",critic_review
Strays,Cody Dericks,"“Strays” clearly knows exactly what it is – a disposable piece of entertaining diversion. But besides the pawful of jokes that do work, its thin plot and stomach-churning humor make this the kind of film that’s a waste of both human and dog time.","Aug 17, 2023",critic_review
Strays,Hope Madden,"There’s a Point A (the scary city block where Doug abandoned his dog) and Point B (Doug’s penis), but those steps in between are random skits about red rockets and chew toys. And those moments are just not funny enough to merit a full feature.","Aug 17, 2023",critic_review

Strays,Adam Sandler,"Thought it would have been funnier with Will Ferrel in it and Will Forte. To me it was average compared to step brothers or taladega nights.

Strays,FRANCIS C,"This was a charming movie with exciting twists and laughs. The only negative I would give was the amount of profanity. If not for the language and a few sexual references, this could have been a great family movie, too.","Aug 28, 2023",audience_review

Strays,Tammy J.,Cute movie with adult humor. If you like dogs youll like it. Its definitely not a movie for children. The f word was way over used and thats my only complaint.

The Pod Generation,Daniel M. Kimmel,"Those looking for a thoughtful, gentle film which will leave you with something to think about will find “The Pod Generation” offers views a “what if?” that may not be as far-fetched as we might like.","Aug 12, 2023",critic_review

The Pod Generation,Nick Johnston,"What’s fascinating is how Barthes lets the unease sit with some of the genuine benefits of a hassle-free world and their equally fundamental flaws, and how intensely she preserves the question of whether these means are justified by the end they achieve.","Feb 2, 2023",critic_review
The Pod Generation,Ema Sasic,"It’s a shame that “The Pod Generation” falls flat in the end because Barthes raises many fascinating points. If this technology were available, would humans embrace it?

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Nick Hasted,"There is still the familiar pleasure of the Guardians’ company, free of the Avengers’ government-sponsored gravitas. Gunn is too fond of them for a cruel last go-round, kindly completing their story.","May 8, 2023",critic_review
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Tim Brennan,"The final film in the Guardians franchise never feels like it was made by committee or Chat GPT. It’s got loads of action, lots of heart, and could only have been made by James Gunn.","May 8, 2023",critic_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Sebastian Zavala Kahn,"Those who already love these characters will laugh and cry with the film, and those who know little or nothing about them will still have a good time (though again, if you're an animal lover, you should bring a box of Kleenex).

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Patrick Hicks,"Yet another big, loud, and fun intergalactic adventure. Worthy of the big screen and your time, even at two plus hours with some tough to swallow animal violence, it manages to send off its main characters in an emotionally satisfying way.","May 8, 2023",critic_review
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Ryan Silberstein,"Beyond the found family dynamic, if these movies have a central theme, it’s these losers spitting in the eye of (a) god as payback for existing in a universe that is uncaring at best.","May 7, 2023",critic_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Noah Berlatsky,"When the Guardians get into a big group hug at the end of the film, it’s supposed to evoke love and solidarity.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Alison Gillmor,"A kooky, messy grab-bag of a flick, the third and reportedly final entry in the Guardians of the Galaxy saga mixes up the good, the bad and the completely bizarre with lots of gonzo energy but sometimes questionable judgment.","May 6, 2023",critic_review
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Patrick McDonald,"90% of this was the situational emotion, and I didn't connect.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Collin Garbarino,"Gunn signals the somber direction in the opening scene and carries it through to the end credits.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Lupe Rodriguez Haas,"Cutting back and forth between the light-hearted moments with the Guardians, and young Rocket’s story is jarring in tone and slows down the pacing.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,David Lynch,"Gunn the true-blue genre imagineer has almost always been able to pick up the slack from Gunn the overcompensating writer, even as the latter can’t resist to show every character that speaks, roars or chortles how much he loves them.","May 6, 2023",critic_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Micheal Compton,"It all adds up to a fitting swan song for one of the most beloved groups in the Marvel Comics Universe. If this is truly the end, it’s been a fun and rather memorable ride.","May 6, 2023",critic_review
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Erik Kain,"James Gunn sticks the landing with the third and final Guardians movie. It’s an emotionally powerful, wildly inventive, often hilarious tour de force farewell for our ragtag band of intergalactic space heroes.","May 6, 2023",critic_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Ryan Syrek,"As a fan of Cronenbergian body horror, is it hypocritical to find “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3” repulsive for its copious CGI animal torture? No!

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Chris Knight,"Rocket’s backstory, though often overshadowed by exploding spaceships, space stations and planets, is actually kind of sweet.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Gayle Sequeira,"It doesn't entirely escape the fast-drying cement of MCU convention, but in true James Gunn style, it goes down swinging.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,PopcornBabe,"I loved this movie and plan on watching it again as soon as it is available to stream. This is probably my favorite of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies so far. The psychology in the movie is well done. The stakes in the movie are high, the characters, tone, and emotional turmoil of the movie are well done. The movie is very engaging and very good at invoking the intended emotions for a given scene. I know multiple people who shed tears while watching this movie. As a bonus, I that more character background details were revealed. I will say that this is a movie I recommend more for adults than children, and if you are sensitive to certain types of trauma-related content in movies maybe check out a parental guide prior to watching to see if this is a movie that may be too much for you. Some of the characters or portrayed as being in certain types of traumatic, life-or-death, and/or abusive situations.","Jul 22, 2023",audience_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Terri R,"One of the reasons I go to a Guardians of the Galaxy movie is for how they integrate nostalgic music into the movie's scenes to add excitement. Song choices in this movie suck, and they are cover artists, not the originals. I guess they didn't want to spend money on the original artists' versions. The acting was phoned in, and the plot line is ridiculous. I felt I was watching a spoof of the Guardians' movies, instead of the tongue in cheek versions we are used to. I cannot believe this has lasted in the theaters.","Jul 9, 2023",audience_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Spencer Chattin,"Can’t gush over this one enough. The fights were some of the best choreographed in Marvel ever, or at least in a long while. The cherry on top was the writing. The story was heartbreaking and heartwarming at the same time, which made for a good mix of emotions mixed with the humor, which I’d say was both funny and well-timed. And the characters were written very well, each one behaving how we’ve come to know them while also still growing. Overall, 10/10.","Jul 9, 2023",audience_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Alice,"Although predictable, GOTG 3 deserves a thumbs up for excitement . A few parts were a little confusing if you have not seen other recent Marvel movies.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Timothy T,"As usual for GotG, the music was the biggest star. Whomever it is that curates the music for these films shares my sensibilities and my playlist. Other than that, I appreciate the sometimes subtle humor they slip in surreptitiously. The action sequences were frenetic and nearly seizure inducing, par for the course in Marvel movies, but creative enough to hold my attention. The plot? Yes, there was one! Im not sure I could repeat it back aa a logical narrative, but thats not really the reason I watch superhero movies so theres no point in even referencing it. Suffice it to say, the bad guys lost, the good guys won, there were sacrifices made, etc., etc., blah blah blah. Bottom line not the greatest film ever made, but loads of fun for me.","Jul 1, 2023",audience_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,The Sage,"Man, this movie truly bummed me out. I have been a fan since 2014 and remember taking my kids to the first Guardians movie. We loved them all (even the christmas show) and love to rewatch them for their humor and the joy of a ""found family"" story. But man, this is a nasty, violent and ugly end to this franchise. The movie opens with a really dark and disturbing shot of rocket getting tortured and has a lot of really disturbing scenes. I'm not kidding I almost walked out. If you love animal abuse this is the movie for you. There is no real ""humor"" just the Guardians yelling at each other. Gamora is treated like a nasty, shitty unpleasant witch. Drax an absolute buffoon. Nebula shrill and screaming constantly. Star Lord straight up mercs some guy and drowns him a river while using a knife to tear off a piece of equipment. He later says ""kill everyone"" WHAT? The tone is all wrong. It's like a suicide squad remake of this beloved franchise. AWFUL.","Jun 29, 2023",audience_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,LetterJ13,"I know all of these movies typically have a McGuffin to find ... but this one was absolutely pointless. The whole movie was also just one big send off to those who no longer wanted to play their characters anymore. No real story other than Rocket origin ... which honestly who cares? You waste some of the best characters by not using them for their expected comedic banter between one another. You don't resolve storylines. You build up new characters, only to make them shallow installments to a ""grand finale"". This movie could have been a way better farewell for some of the Gaurdians by actually making their goodbyes mean something. But Fiege and co are no longer willing to push the envelope and let some of their characters die for the better good, both in story telling and sacrificial love for their fellow characters.","Jun 29, 2023",audience_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Ian c,"It is hard to replicate the magic of 1 but they did a great job with Rockets back story - which needed to be told. What also needed to be told but wasnt was the Peter/ Gammorra break up story - unless I missed it in one of the endless Marvel movies that only my kids watch -guess Ill ask them. That being said, I am 59 so the soundtrack left me cold, and its a huge part of the genre backbone. Also the super sweet over the top happy ending stuff was absurd and out of place. Felt like the iron fist of Disney stepped in and vetoed legit creative narrative for sure. Also had the weird sense I got at end of Mando S3 when all the loose ends are tied up and they can move on to a new project and leave this one in the dust if they want to. Overall, glad I went, couldnt not go regardless, always been a big fan of the series. But a little let down after all was said and done.","Jun 24, 2023",audience_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Adam,"While not perfect, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is a fun standalone film from the rest of the current MCU, essentially acting as an epilogue for this last story from the Infinity Saga. Characterization feels a bit off in some moments, where characters yell at each other for no reason. Rockets backstory is shown periodically through flashbacks and are some of the most emotional moments in the film. I think the aspect that the film succeeds best at is showing how the Guardians are a family who will go to any lengths when one of their own is in need. I thought Adam Warlock was fine, though I certainly understand why people wouldnt like this portrayal. High Evolutionary is a great villain, very psychotic and insane evil enough that you really want to see the heroes take him down, yet he doesnt need to be trying to conquer the universe or whatever to get that effect. Not a fan of this films depiction of Gamora. Overall, Id recommend giving this film a watch. Itll probably be the last good film of the MCU, and even if you have checked out of the modern MCU this film serves as a good-enough final epilogue to this great group of characters. 3.5/5","Jun 23, 2023",audience_review

The Equalizer 2,Marc Z,"This movie is not as good as its predecessor, but still very, very good. It picks up where the prior film left off, but is, clearly, a stand alone film. Denzel is the heart of the film, and it starts out with an exciting scene on a train. This one has more of an international spy thriller feel than the original; however, it still has some personal storylines of saving people close to home. One of the best things is also one of the worst things about this one-that is that we go deeper into Ross McCall. In the original we know there is more to him but not sure what. It has to be revealed. In this one he is already revealed to be the former special agent and nuanced killer. This is really good. The supporting cast of Bill Pullman, Melissa Leo, and Pedro Pascal are really good. I love this series.","Sep 5, 2023",audience_review

The Equalizer 2,Dylan D,"Denzel Washington helms a sequel that is Equal parts superior and carbon in execution to its predecessor. Returning to the role of an aged assassin who apparently off screen went through the emotional turmoil and narrative complexity of returning to a life long since abandoned, Denzel is a hired hitman of sorts that splits his time between righting the wrongs of society with unquestioned, impunitive violence, and driving around Brooklyn as nothing more than an excuse for shameless product place. The pacing is actually improved in the sequel. I was pleasantly surprised that over an hour of the movie passed without feeling like a chore, though of course, the third act tries its damndest to make up for this faux pas. In place of Chloe Grace Moretz, we have Ashton Sanders, whose entire character is he really wants to draw, which is a decidedly marked retrogression from an abused, possibly underaged hooker that's in the class A team, stuck in her daydreams. The antagonist though is a definitive improvement, stepping up from the likes of Steven Segal's ""writing"" to the likes of a Metal Gear Solid villain. My frustration grows at this fact as the politically charged catalyst for the movie's plot is completely ignored after the second act. The returning amalgamation of divergent genres, desperately trying to be contused together is still readily present, haphazardly thrown on the screen in the desperate hope that something will stick.","Sep 1, 2023",audience_review
The Equalizer 2,Diana M,"Robert McCall is still retired and living in Boston. The ex-CIA agent finally has balanced out his life and is very happy. He works as a Lyft driver and moonlights as a ""good guy"" vigilante. He seems to thrive on helping those who cannot help themselves ""Its great you helping all these random people. Stay off the radar."" - Susan But when his close friend, DIA agent Susan Plummer is killed, the ""mild mannered"" Lyft driver morphs back into a Black Ops Assassin and goes on a bloody quest for vengeance. ""The mistake you made was you killed my friend. So, I'm gonna kill each and every one of you, and the only disappointment in it for me is that I only get to do it once."" - McCall What appears to have been a simple robbery gone bad during a international investigation, is not what it seems. McCall discovers a conspiracy of planned murders... And this one is way too close to home. So the story is a bit predictable but I did not care. I really enjoyed watching Denzel Washington hunt down and literally destroy the bad guys with his unorthodox array of makeshift weapons. The journey from start to ending was both fun and entertaining. I cannot wait for ""The Equalizer 3"" Cast - Denzel Washington, Pedro Pascal, Ashton Sanders, Melissa Leo, Bill Pullman, Orson Bean","Aug 23, 2023",audience_review
The Equalizer 2,Katie D,"Similar to the first movie, it's more drama than action. However the action itself, particularly the car scene, is excellent. The acting was also excellent all around.

It was entertaining though and I enjoyed it.","Aug 19, 2023",audience_review
The Equalizer 2,Dallas H,"It was entirely abandoned by the notion that Denzel Washington is portraying a retired CIA Operative who passed the time earning extra cash as a Lyft driver. The entire course of actions involving him being a rideshare driver in this movie is absurd and a transparent cash grab by the movie studio with the product placement. As a result, it forced me to return to reality. I could not step into a suspension of disbelief; it is that bad. The first movie in the series is enjoyable. But this second one is a significant step-down. I hope the third installment will be equally satisfying as the first flick.","Aug 18, 2023",audience_review

The Equalizer 2,Johnathon W,"Solid revenge flick thanks to Denzel delivering another stellar lead performance and some nice direction by Antoine Fuqua. The cast is solid, with Denzel delivering his trademark lead performance as Robert McCall, a deadly assassin with a righteous mission. He gets solid support from the rest of the cast, especially Pedro Pascal as his old colleague. Behind the camera, Fuqua delivers a solid revenge flick with McCall dealing out some righteous and brutal justice. While the action is solid, the plot is rather generic, resulting in a fun but not remarkable movie. Nevertheless, a fun watch on Hulu.","Aug 7, 2023",audience_review

Ends up with everybody complaining 'cause nobody did what anybody could've done or should've done to begin with."" This interaction best encapsulates The Equalizer. Usually movies have what's called a ""sophomore slump,"" regardless who the director is. It's hard to write an original project and even harder to write a follow-up. But on occasion, a sequel can be as good, if not better than the original. I'll admit, this movie is it. Imo Antoine Fuqua proves why he's one of the better directors working today. There's some truly innovative cinematography and storytelling here that only serves to elaborate and expand on the world created in the first movie.","Apr 5, 2023",audience_review

The Equalizer 2,N/A,"This movie is a bit more subtle then the first. The story of the first was focus around the actions and the tactical violence. This time you actually get the agent doing some searching and analyzing in between point A to point B. It's not sexy and slow the pace of the movie, but I think it is necessary. It also shows that Denzel can do this character on a different level of acting. The action is still gory and violent. The tactical aspect of it is still present. Good music. Maybe the storm at the end was more or less convincing at times. I give it 72%.

He still sets his timer and calculates the length of his fights. They still didn't hold back on the blood and gore. Denzel Washington's acting is still exceptional. He really puts his heart into his craft. His stage presence always demands your full attention. The first movie had better fight sequences though. And the middle part's pacing is rather slow. But it's worth noting that the final battle is quite original. I think it has never been done before. This movie feels more like an espionage film and it has several suspenseful scenes, especially towards the end.","Jan 17, 2022",audience_review

Once again we have a tired familiar old storyline we have seen many times before. The movie benefits from some well staged action sequences and the supporting cast is decent. I will admit I liked seeing a pre ""Mandalorian"" Pedro Pascal. He gives, as I said previously, a decent performance. ""The Equalizer 2"" is worth seeing only once but not again.

The Equalizer 2,ronald f,"its May 2021 and a few days ago I started binge watching The Equalizer 2, I do this sometimes, watching something over and over again, see this, miss that, but see it another time... First: For me this Sequel is much better then the first one. Second: off course its cliche, cheesy, again there is a guy cleaning the streets from bad people, again a highly trained guy, the Nobody. Third: Denzel Washington makes this guy enjoyable. Fourth: Its not entirely his show, that's the surprise for me and makes this movie (for me) really good. There are certain moments, chemistry between actors, scenes...Bill Pullman and Melissa Leo are wonderful in the 2 scenes they have together, short scenes and every time i see them I am sad not to see them more...Pullman after her death sad, broken...its natural, believable. Moving. Pedro Pascal is excellent, not the usual villain, actually no villain. In Part One this was easy, bad Russians...Part 2 is more difficult...not much more...but more. Again...Padro Pascal and Melissa Leo...the Video Chat Scene, the conversation before the elevator...I get interested in seeing another movie, a movie, where Pascal is not the villain and Melissa survives. also...all the Scenes Washington and Pascal have together. Off course the movie leaves us with questions, so the door is a little open for a third one. There are many survivors in this movie, this is something, that can be dismissed as cheesy, the Holocaust Survivor or the black kid, that needs a father figure... but in the end, when the old man meets his lost sister, Fatima sees the new painting, McCall is back home and Miles paints and meets a girl...well i like that, the light after the dark.","May 20, 2021",audience_review

The Equalizer 2,robert r,"There are scrub leading men, there are average leading men, there are A-list leading men and then there's Denzel Washington. Regardless of the director, screenplay or supporting cast, the guy simply elevates every project he's associated with to — at the very least — par. I've yet to see a truly unenjoyable movie with him at the forefront. ""The Equalizer 2"" is no different. As an admitted fan of the first film, I can't say I wasn't excited to see him re-team with Antoine Fuqua for a follow-up. And, while it's nowhere near as much of a pleasant surprise as the first installment, it's still thoroughly entertaining. The action is helmed with unsurprising vigor, once again proving Fuqua's innate understanding of how to craft a good set piece. It's the screenplay, however, that sadly brings up the rear this time around, what with its inability to truly replicate that same sort of novelty and creativity I enjoyed so much about the first film. There are some decent little flourishes to the narrative here and there (namely the way that a few scenes are staged and also one particular subplot involving ""Moonlight"" standout Ashton Sanders) but you're really only here to see Denzel kick all sorts of ass. I'm just disappointed that this fact is a tad more overt now than it was in 2014.","Oct 12, 2020",audience_review
The Equalizer 2,N/A,"It was a good enough movie to pass the time, and tone was pretty good. Easy to hang with Denzel and his character was pretty good.

Lots of good action scenes that helped speed things along. Cast & Crew: (4/5) Denzel Washington was excellent.

The Equalizer 2,N/A,"Denzel Washington returns as Robert McCall in this all out action sequel. While I always enjoy watching Washington on screen, the film itself felt eerily similar to the first film when it came to certain scenes and their structure--as a result, this film felt more like a ""one-trick-pony"" rather than a new, innovative sequel. Furthermore, there is one massive plot hole in the story that's impossible to ignore and adds to its detriment. In short, this film is good but may be seen as a hit or miss to some and that's largely because this film fails to innovate or introduce new ideas to reinvent the franchise. In short, this film is an example of what happens when you play it safe creatively instead of taking creative risks. The first film had a much larger impact.","Sep 2, 2020",audience_review

The Equalizer 2,N/A,"I was a fan of the first Equalizer movie, and was interested to see what the same team could do with a sequel. Denzel Washington is still great in the lead role, although it felt like they downplayed a lot of the character’s OCD tendencies in this film. The repetition of his life seemed to play into his skill, and it also gave a calm and controlled vibe to all of his aggressive actions, which makes them seem more intimidating by comparison. They touched on a few of the key details that defined The Equalizer, but only briefly, and never made it an essential part of his story. I was a bit surprised after the setup we see in the first film, that this wasn’t a plot where our hero is hired in order to help someone else in need. However, I appreciated that this story made his mission more personal. Taking a cue from the run of modern action movies like Taken and John Wick, it simply works better for our hero to have emotion driving him, because it makes us care more as an audience. I’m not sure if we were supposed to be surprised in any way when we discover who is behind the murders, but it is such a cliche that I never doubted it for a moment (not to mention, the actor in question looks like a villain to begin with.) It also felt a bit odd how little The Equalizer 2 cared to explore motivations or who is ultimately responsible for the killings. This is one of the most streamlined explorations of a revenge plot that I’ve ever seen. Yet there’s enough meat on the bone for me to still get some enjoyment out of it. If I had one major complaint about The Equalizer 2 it would be that the hero is too infallible. He never once makes a mistake, he never misses a shot, and he never gets injured himself. In a way it dehumanizes him a bit too much and turns him into a superhero. That doesn’t make The Equalizer 2 a bad movie, but it’s nothing special, just a moderately entertaining revenge film to fill a couple hours.","Jul 24, 2020",audience_review

The Equalizer 2,N/A,"Denzel Washington is a good actor. Antoine Fuqua is a good director. The first Equalizer was an above-average vigilante action flick. Its sequel is okay at best. The action sequences are still well-staged and there are a couple of good scenes. And I was actually on board with the ""murder mystery"" angle, obvious culprit because ""I saw him in that one movie or TV show"" notwithstanding. But one problem the movie does have is its pacing and subplots. We get it, Robert McCall is quite the friendly, approachable individual when he's not kicking ass. Being based off of a TV show is no excuse. Look how well that turned out for ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"". To be fair, this flaw was in the first film as well but here's the thing: not only was it handled better but since the big-screen adaptation of a TV show you've probably never heard of was meant to be an origin story of sorts for the character, then it was more forgivable. For the sequel, you have a bigger budget. What's stopping you from just going full-on John Wick? It doesn't help that these subplots have little to no effect on the plot. It takes about 45 minutes for the main conflict kick in, by the way. While it gets better from that point on, The Equalizer 2/II is an action sequel that's a letdown and that's coming from someone who saw the first film as just above-average. Hopefully Denzel Washington and Antoine Fuqua will get another chance with a third film or even a sequel to another D.W. film that would lend itself well to a continuation...one does exist somewhere in that filmography of his, right?","May 10, 2020",audience_review
The Equalizer 2,christopher b,"Of all the movies that Denzel Washington has under his belt, this had to be the one to spawn his first-ever sequel. To be fair, I quite enjoyed the first movie and Denzel made Robert McCall a compelling presence to be reckoned with. ""The Equalizer"" is based on a TV show from the late 1980s and this movie feels a lot more episodic in that sense but not in a good way. It is one thing for Antonie Fuqua to return as director for a second time but unfortunately his work here feels largely pedestrian and lackluster. Gone is the first film's intrigue and grit, despite the brutal takedowns we still get to see. Even the action is few and far in between with sparse excitement. Maybe a TV show reboot would have served this iteration of ""The Equalizer"" in the long run. Denzel Washington's ""Equalizer"" movies seem to take a similar narrative pattern to the ""John Wick"" series: starting out with the ambiguity of the hero and steady reveal what he capable of; only to explore the character and his world further in a sequel. At least the ""John Wick"" movies are wonderfully consistent, where both the action/world developed. With this franchise, I don't see it enduring without some changes for potential screenplays and a different director to help keep things fresh. Getting back to 'The Equalizer 2', the plot is horrendously jumbled and the story is terribly unfocused. The movie takes a lot of time to get to the meat of it all and these ""good Samaritan"" vignettes, while admirable in showing the facets of the lead character, don't seem to have much weight to the plot and depth on their own with a severe lack of cohesion to the whole. Denzel Washington still gives a reliable performance and there are good moments sprinkled though-out; whether it be the short car-interior fight in the middle of the movie or a couple tense scenes with Ashton Sanders' character. may get the job done, 'The Equalizer 2' is a prime example of ""more of the same"" with lesser results; it severely lacks substance and runs short on style - 5.5/10 (C)","Apr 29, 2020",audience_review

The Equalizer 2,christopher l,"As a follow up to the original, I enjoyed much of this sequel. It has emotion, drama, plotting, good editing. All that a good movie should have. But the third act lacks flavour. The action is smooth, the dialogue is fair, but the theme and scenes don't give the same feel as the warehouse gunfight in the original. It's good, but not great.","Feb 6, 2020",audience_review

The Equalizer 2,N/A,"Doesn't disappoint as an action yarn with a hair more introspection and heart than the usual fare.

The Equalizer 2,Late R,"Convoluted and unengaging, ‘Equalizer 2' spends too much time focusing on the wrong details. That leaves us with a film that feels very light on the thrilling action you'd expect (apart from the odd fight sequence here and there, it wasn't until the final 40 mins. that I really felt like it was moving), but just as importantly, doesn't put nearly enough time into establishing and developing the various characters relationship to McCall (played, once again, by the always great Denzel Washington, but even he can't save this one). Ultimately, those two faults together means it's a mostly uninteresting affair that fails to build upon the success of its predecessor.","Dec 8, 2019",audience_review
The Equalizer 2,N/A,"Well entertaining, again. I enjoyed watching Denzel. The action was ok. The story was pretty cliched again. The big reveal was very obvious, no surprise there, unfortunately.

The Equalizer 2,brendan n,"This fell into the typical cliché riddled story mode and it lost all the hard work created in the first film. They never invested enough time in the friendship to pull off this story beat and the film doesn't work. I enjoyed the first film and when you compare the films, the sequel is less interesting story wise. Washington is the key here and even he cannot rescue the contrived plot chosen by the filmmakers. I wanted to like this film and the action can only compensate for so much. The supporting plots felt uninspired and with only a few of the subplots paying off. Good action scenes but a friend death that means nothing and serves zero purpose is wasted. Hopefully they can redeem themselves with a third film. 08/08/2019","Aug 8, 2019",audience_review

The Equalizer 2,N/A,"Strengths: A lot of what worked the first time around for The Equalizer is back. The action continues to be well shot, set up in an interesting manner, and completely violent. It may be a bit much for some, but I think it works in this movie. You come to see violence and you get that. Denzel Washington (Robert McCall) is once again solid as our protagonist. It's not one of his better performances, but he does as much as he can with the character. It's enough to make him way more interesting and watchable than he is on paper. I feel like Ashton Sanders (Miles Whittaker), Pedro Pascal (Dave York), Bill Pullman (Brian Plummer), and Melissa Leo (Susan Plummer) all also brought their acting chops. Weaknesses: I liked how focused the first film was. McCall had vengeance on his mind and that drove him. Here, they were too ambitious and threw in way too many subplots. Everything involving the Miles character is kind of a waste. I liked the actor but his side story felt disjointed. We already knew that McCall was a good person other than being a killer. Him helping someone like Miles didn't add anything, especially since it was so separate from the rest of the story. Characters kind of move in and out and there are so many that you ultimately don't care about many. When it gets to the big action scene near the end, it's all so hollow that none of it felt like it mattered. I didn't care enough about the people or the stakes, so it was as if none of it even happened. Overall: If you love Denzel and violence, you'll probably enjoy most of this. The script has too many problems because it tries to do too much. That makes it a wildly average movie.","May 16, 2019",audience_review

The Equalizer 2,N/A,"Equalizer 2 (The Sequel of Equalizer). There are some names I LOVE in the movie industry, who have made their own names as Brand in the industry. One of them is, Denzel Washington, one of the best of the best actors in the industry, Working in the Industry for about 40 years, for the first time starred in his own sequel""Equalizer"", --------------- Among the best lines from the movie ""This ain't a perfect world. People do bad things. If you're lucky, you get a chance to... set it right. But... Most of the time, it goes unpunished. This ain't one of them times. The mistake you made was you killed my friend. So, I'm gonna kill each and every one of you. And the only disappointment in it for me is that I only get to do it once."" -------------- The opening of the Istambul sequence is so good, and that is the iconic style, super beautiful, with beautiful Cinematography by OLIVER WOOD, Who was the Cinematographer of FACEOFF, directed by my ever favorite JOHN WOO. Long story short, This is a movie of perfect gem's artwork. This is the movie i want to watch with my notebook ready to bookmark points and download the script, read it multiple times, watch over and over again. if you love Action Thriller and Crime, you can not miss this Masterpiece by Antoine Fuqua, The Award Winning director of King Arthur, Equalizer, and many more under his working history.","Apr 1, 2019",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Kelsey E,"I cannot get enough of this movie. Yes, the first few minutes may be a bit Hallmark-y, but it has to be in order to embrace the loveably ridiculous premise. And I actually think that makes the rest of the movie shine brighter, because it subverts the initial expectations of a fluffy, empty rom-com, delivering a story with substance, thought-provoking ideals, and emotions that feel incredibly real. The cast has remarkable chemistry and no performance seems phoned in. Without even taking into account that he has no previous experience directing a movie or series, Matthew Lopez does a fantastic job at pulling the audience into the lives of the characters. His use of long-takes makes sense with his award-winning background in directing stage performances, and the scenes in which he uses this technique feel lived in and visceral. The writers and director expertly balance feel-good romance with poignant (and very relevant) social issues without forcing it. Everything feels rooted and inexplicably relatable, which is not an easy feat when the two main characters are, on paper, exceptionally incomparable. It is grounded in the reality of the struggles prominent public figures can face if they are in the LGBTQ+ community, while also giving us hope, confidence, and an energetic belief in ourselves and the world. I have never once read the book upon which a movie I love is based. I still haven't read Pride and Prejudice, even though a beautiful edition has been sitting on my shelf for years. Red, White & Royal Blue is the exception. I bought the hard cover Collector's Edition and finished reading it within a day. I will eventually (probably) stop watching it nearly every day, but I can't imagine I will ever tire of it or the joy it brings me.","Sep 7, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Ella M,"As a lover of the book by Casey McQuiston, I had high hopes for this movie. And while all of my hopes were not or could not be met, this movie absolutely stands out as a modern take on classic rom/com tropes and I would 100% recommend it to people who haven't read the book. It is a relatively easy watch, full of charming humour and loveable characters. The performances from both Zakhar-Perez and Galitzine are beautiful to watch and their chemistry is actually INSANE. However- a warning to any OG book fans- where this movie failed for me was its' role as an adaptation. Several (what I would consider crucial) plot points were removed for reasons i cannot fathom, and the removal of (SPOILER ALERT) June left a gap in the heart of Alex's character. If you want an easy to watch, a loveable romantic comedy, RWRB could be the movie for you. If you're a diehard book fan, watch the film with a grain of salt and take it for what it is not what it could be.","Sep 7, 2023",audience_review

The chemistry between Taylor Zakhar Perez and Nicholas Galitzine is electric and makes it very easy to not only believe, but get drawn into Alex and Henry's story. If you're a hardcore fan of the book, there are things you'll probably not love (characters who don't appear in the movie, events/elements that don't take place, changes to certain relationships, etc.), but if you can appreciate the movie on its own, it is DEFINITELY worth watching a time or 20.","Sep 4, 2023",audience_review

(Apart from Brokeback Mountain)From the New York Times' best-selling novel ""Red, White and Royal Blue"", this film is both brilliant, subtle and incandescent.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Agustina Macarena M,"No pensé que amaría tanto esta historia. La novela sobre como dos enemigos publicos, terminan teniendo que fingir una amistad para que las relaciones entre los dos países a los que representan no entren en un enorme conflicto político no me llamaba la atención. Pero, luego de leer el libro quedé tan enamorada de la historia, que esperaba con ansias el estreno de esta adaptación. Hay muchos pequeños detalles que me faltaron, pero entiendo que en realidad no aportaban gran cosa a la trama de estos dos chicos, por lo que no me molesta que no estén. - Los personajes que fueron quitados y /o reemplazados fueron cambios que beneficiaron a esta adaptación. - Las escenas que todos los fanáticos pedíamos, estuvieron (aunque una solo apareció como escena eliminada y en el trailer). - El reemplazo de cómo salen a la luz los e-mails, no me disgustó. - El detalle de que aquí alex tiene 1/2 asumida su bisexualidad fue un gran punto a favor. ¿Lo malo? Solo una cosa: en la peli no son dos Freakis, cuando en el libro sí que lo son, y es parte importante. Pero, la verdad es que la riqueza de esta adaptación está en la sutileza de los detalles y pequeñas referencias al libro del que sale. - Por mucho tiempo, esta va a pasar a ser mi adaptación literaria favorita de libro no perteneciente a una saga.","Aug 31, 2023",audience_review

These are films that don't meet the minimum quality standards for theatrical release and are aired on network television as filler content, often after mealtime.

It is sweet but not cheesy; it is clever but not vulgar; avoids most of the nastiest stereotypes; it is slick but not overpoduced. I guess in succesive sightings of the film, more and more little clever details, expressions, lines will be more noticed and appreciated. Definitely, not a wasted, jaded,old cliché of a movie. Not being American all the fuss about Ms Thurman Southern accent escaped me. They even included a song by one of my favourite (and quite, quite obscure) performers...

The plot is the classic story between two boys with the usual problems that can arise (especially if they are such prominent characters). The dialogues are brilliant and funny.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Luis H,"Brilliant Such a great movie. The entire cast, especially the two main characters (Alex and Henry) made me fall in love with the story. Yes it's a fairy tale, but such a sweet one and with a happy ending. The prince does get his guy after all. It made me smile, it made me sob. So many heartfelt moments. I thought the funniest moment was when Zahra opened the closet to get a ""Good Morning"" from Henry. I cried in the last third of the movie. One of my favorite moments was when Alex gave the press conference and said that he fell in love with a person who happened to be a man and this man was HRH Prince Henry... Another tearful moment was when they danced at the museum and let's not forget when the crowds were cheering for them outside Buckingham Palace. I am happy they chose to not shy away from the intimate moments and the sex scenes. Granted there were more in the book, but the movie was sweet. After watching the movie, I read the book. I find both to be very good. Now I have watched the movie numerous times and read over some parts of the book more than once as well. Through social media comments I have realized that I am one of many many people who are obsessed with this movie and who have watched it over and over again.

The love story between Alex and Henry is perfectly told in the film.. the casting was excellent, I can't imagine abetter pairing. Zahara was the best... loved her character! I enjoyed the whole film.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Michi D,"I don't write reviews even for shows/movies I do like, but for this movie I just had to! The story is a light, feel good watch, without shying away from showing the difficulties faced in queer relationships, esp that of public figures. We have a fair share of varied cast and reactions and I find it refreshing actually that for a change we have parents who support their child's happiness and in loving who they want to love. Taylor and Nick's chemistry as Alex and Henry is so electric that they had you rooting for their happy ending from the get-go. The whole golden retriever - black cat is so evident on the little nuances of of their facial expressions and I find myself enamored with their bickering and lowkey (high key) flirting haha! And the climax confrontation followed by the little dance and hope/light at the end of the tunnel- gosh, you can really easily empathize with the both of them so much and want to protect them and their happiness. I really especially love Alex's speeches, and Taylor's energy and confidence is so brilliant that I resonate in everything Alex says. Alex's smiles are really so infectious, and the way he delivers is so convincing and moving. Henry's vulnerability is also very palpable and Nick's range of emotions onscreen is just amazing. I also applaud the backstage team especially the director and creative team including sounds because I really did feel transported to their story as if I was experiencing all of it with them in such an artistic, whimsical way. Director Matthew, you have my super thanks at such a gorgeous go-to comfort movie that I will always rewatch I bet for years to come. My only small gripe is that it feels rushed due to time constraint, so much so that their thoughts and emotions become whiplash and you don't get to dig in and let it settle before the scene/situation changes. I wish we could've gotten a series in order to explore more the depths of their complex situations and how they overcome the challenges in order to be together. I even subscribed to Prime just to be able to legally stream this one movie many more times. I do wish we get more of RWRB in the future!","Aug 24, 2023",audience_review

Taylor Zakhar Perez and Nicholas Galitzine do not dissapoint. They're the perfect Alex and Henry, and their chemistry formula can be noticed in each single frame of the story, since the cake disaster, to the last kiss they ever give on the outside of Buckingham Palace. Characters, setting, and music (very good soundtrack choice, by the way) make this rom-com the best of the summer so far. Personally, hadn't been touched by any queer movie since ""Love, Simon"" and ""Call Me By Your Name"". ""Read, White and Royal Blue"" is your next movie you'll want to watch over and over.","Aug 24, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Martin J,"I hadn't read the book, so watched the movie with no pre-conceived ideas. Red, White and Royal Blue, in my opinion, is simply a masterpiece of the romcom genre. No, it's not serious, it doesn't have a message to relay, all it does do is shows two people having the relationship everybody dreams of. We all know it's not real but isn't that the point of a romcom? Is the script great? No, some of the lines were cheesy to say the least, but the chemistry between Nicholas and Taylor is electrifying to watch, both hilarious and emotional from one minute to the next overcoming any dubious writing. The rest of the cast were excellent, but I would like to have seen more of Rachel Hilson (Nora). If I have one suggestion, please don't make a sequel just because you can. Of course, there will be many crying for it and based on its success, Amazon will surely be tempted. I can only say that it is a one off and should remain so.","Aug 22, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Rishabh A,"This is a fluffy, lightweight, kinda endearing Romcom that settles for being entertainingly good, whereas it *could* have been Great. The chemistry between Taylor Zakhar Perez (as Alex) and Nicholas Galantine (as Henry) is electrifying, meaningful and full of pop. It really elevates the film. As an aside, Nick looks uncannily like a better looking version of what Macaulay Culkin looked like in his 20s! He displays excellent acting chops as well, in several dramatic scenes - like the one at Alex's New Year's eve party where Henry comes to terms with his infatuation/attraction to Alex; the scene where Alex confesses his love for him and Henry is plagued by fears and uncertainties of how to reconcile their love with his duties as a Prince; as well as the later scene where they have a heated confrontation in Kensington Palace. Taylor is an absolute revelation here - he brings a compelling charm and charisma to his portrayal of Alex. His physicality and good looks certainly help - but it's not just his chiseled musculature or his luxuriant eyelashes (which Miguel Ramos' character pointedly references while making a pass at Alex!!) that are at play here, but also the fact that he can express so many emotions through just a smile or a glance. From snarky smirk to cheeky grin to tender, romantic smile to a wry, wistful expression - he flashes these as needed, with a full-on star wattage that is impossible to look away from. Special mention here to Uma Thurman, some have been poking fun at her Texan drawl but not being from the US, this frankly wasn't an issue for me. She brought an innate grace, steely charm and power to play in her portrayal as POTUS and her scene with Alex later when he comes out to her, was deeply moving (even if a wee bit OTT ). Also, both Sarah Shahi as the President's Chief of Staff, and Akshay Khanna as Henry's equerry, as superb in their interesting, albeit brief roles. But, that said, much as liked the film and found myself smiling through much of it, I still found it somewhat lightweight. It was syrupy and frothy and while that was charming all right, it certainly missed some of the depth and nuance which could have elevated it to a classic status. Yes, sometimes we are in the mood for a modern fairy-tale equivalent that doesn't challenge us to think much, just entertains with predictable tropes. But if we are to be drawn to a film for one repeat viewing after another, even years later, there is that elusive dividing line between the truly Great films and the merely good ones. Red, White & Royal Blue had the potential, very much so, and the acting chops from it's leading stars, to become Great, but unfortunately very much settles for the ""good"" category. For instance, the downsizing of the character screen times of Nora Holleran and Princess Beatrice work to the movie's detriment. They were important characters to Alex's and Henry's story together, and their respective character arc. Some of the tropes were very predictable indeed- Although the transition of Alex's & Henry's relationship from physical attraction into an emotional bond is executed neatly, the film also follows many cliched tropes of storytelling with most characters behaving in the most stereotypical manner. So basically, if you're in the mood for a heartwarming fairy tale with two Uber-Handsome Dudes instead of the traditional Prince & Princess, then this could be the feel-good escape you're seeking. Just don't expect it to be a groundbreaking classic. After all, on several occasions, an entertaining tale of romance is all we need to make us happy! Plus, for all its shortcomings, this romcom remembers why we like watching people in love on screen, and it never forgets to present Alex & Henry as people.","Aug 22, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Alan W,"Set in a fantasy world where Uma Thurman and Sharon D. Clarke are the American president and British prime minister respectively and Stephen Fry is the QueenKing of Britain, Matthew Lopez's film, based on Casey McQuiston's popular novel (which I've not read), is a LGBTQ-themed romcom between an English prince and the American President's son that is choke full of generic tropes which are effectively, and perhaps formulaically, applied. Coming across like a woke Mills & Boon novel adaptation, with more revealing and steamier sex(y) scenes that I didn't expect to see, the film pitches its two leads as mutually loathing enemies at first before events contrive to push them together and hate turns into love as they get to know each other better. So far so Lifetime/Hallmark film of the week. Opening with a painfully unfunny cake-related meet-cute that introduces them in an unflattering, perhaps borderline obnoxious, manner, thankfully the film manages to recover from that misstep to become more fun and endearing as their courtship develops into a game of hide-and-seek with both the media and their parents. Taylor Zakhar Perez and Nicholas Galitzine have chemistry (kudos to casting) and look cute together, which help immensely for a film of this genre but I do wish there's more space to explore supporting cast members like Sarah Shahi and Rachel Hilson's characters. There's no doubt Lopez has made a very handsome film here, with a few nice quips here and there but wit is in limited supply generally in favour of broader comedy and even broader politics, while there are exactly two visual moments where the film suddenly click into place. Otherwise, this is an idealistic and idealized fairytale of a film that, for the most part, works, if you can skip/endure the first irritating 20 minutes.","Aug 21, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Rick M,"Some critics have likened this film to a Hallmark Movie because of the sweet, predictable tone. However, I'd argue that it's this very quality that is this LGBTQ+ rom -com's strength. Throughout cinematic history, LGBTQ+ storylines have often been relegated to subplots riddled with anguish, tragedy, and a fair share of melancholic endings. The representation was there, yes, but it painted our love stories with a brush of gloom. Yes, ""Red, White & Royal Blue"" is a fairy tale. Yes, it's sweet. It hasn't proposed to be anything else. It's a light-hearted feel-good film that has soul. This makes it the perfect heartwarming escape. Even though the lead roles are played by straight actors, Taylor Sakhar Perez as Alex and Nicholas Galitzine as Harry capture the depth and nuance of these roles. They both deliver genuine performances. Their chemistry is palpable and this makes it easy for us to invest in Alex and Henry's journey from amusing rivalry to heartwarming romance. ""Red, White & Royal Blue"" feels like a love letter to all of us who have yearned for a gay romance that isn't shrouded in despair but beams with possibility and optimism.","Aug 21, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Esteban C,"wow wow wow! this movie is quite literally a fantasy. i loved it so fucking much and it was worth the wait and the hype. well constructed characters, a non-toxic gay relationship and an exploration of themselves and each other's worlds are just a few of the topics this movie handles in two of the most entertaining hours i've had in a while. the premise of the story is just incredible, and given the fact that this one's based off a book, this applies to all formats in which this plot was consumed. the characters and actors chosen to bring them to life are so perfectly chosen for each role is actually painful. the whole love story had a fast pace, which made it more engaging and digestable to consume. it was like a modern fairytale with a fucking wholesome prince and a hot mexican/american. the interaction, the setting and the morals that came from their backgrounds were moving factors that more than setting the premises of their relationship, made the viewers empathize with them and the struggles they had along the way. i loved seeing their personalities (almost opposite of one another) mix and mingle back and forth, as well as the evident character development as i said. and even though we saw a lot of the presidential side of the matter, and i adored every single second of it, i would have loved seeing more on the royal side, because it felt like that topic was touched a little too vague. i wouldn't have cared if the movie was five hours long, i would have enjoyed it even more, and that's something very big for me to say! i loved how they both recognized their mistakes and gave each other time when needed. thy learned from eveything they did wrong and presented us this beautiful love story. i can't wait to read the book (if possible) and i would fucking explode if new movies are announced because this right here made my heart full <3 LONG LIVE PRINCE HENRY AND FIRST SON ALEX!","Aug 21, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Brent M,"There are three things necessary to make a gay romantic comedy work: It needs to involve a readily recognizable gay relationship, it needs an undeniable sense of romance and it has to be funny. However, this heavily diluted, glacially paced piece of insipid celluloid fluff has none of the above, and it truly escapes me how many critics and viewers have found this utterly bland exercise to be heartwarming, charming and involving. In telling the somewhat far-fetched story of an alleged romance between a British prince and the son of an American president who start out as comically exaggerated adversaries but end up supposedly finding true love with one another, writer-director Matthew López subjects his audiences to an unconvincing relationship wholly lacking in chemistry and stemming from an improbable courtship, much of which arises from a string of all-too-convenient, less-than-discreet engagements that are otherwise supposedly impossible to arrange and coordinate. What's more, the film's humor is virtually nonexistent and incorporates none of the edginess generally associated with gay comedies. In fact, it's so dull and so safe that it makes most Hallmark Channel movies seem downright risqué by comparison. To its credit, the picture makes some modestly eloquent statements about LGBTQ+ equality (even if they're nothing we haven't already heard many times before), and it features a fine supporting performance by Sarah Shahi as a smart-mouthed, fast-talking presidential aide (arguably the only genuinely funny element in the film), but it misses the mark on so many other fronts that it's hard to believe this project ever got green-lighted. It's a shame that the door opened by ""Bros"" (2022) to make gay romcoms a more viable cinematic genre has been set back by this underwhelming effort. It's also equally disappointing that an organization like Amazon Studios – one known for generally doing solid work – could let something as sub-par as this out into the movie marketplace. Let's hope moviegoers can put this one quickly behind them and see the foregoing issues soon fixed going forward.","Aug 20, 2023",audience_review

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Mat,"Adapted by from the beloved novel of the same name by Casey McQuiston, RW&RB is a romantic comedy focuses on the relationship between the charismatic US first son, Alex Claremont-Diaz and the perfectly groomed but complex Prince Henry. The initial rivalry will transforme into a camaraderie that may conceal stronger feelings. And while the closeted gay Prince initially takes the initiative of the relationship, winning his heart will require bisexual Alex, boldness and tenacity. Director Matthew López puts himself in the shoes of the masters of the genre, and one can enjoy searching the references of the rom com classics. However, his talent is to never give in to parody, devoting his efforts in nurturing the relationship between his two protagonists with a sometimes poignant sincerity. it results a tender, funny, sexy film, supported an impeccable cast, embodying colourful characters, in the most absurd situations. Present in every scene, Nicholas Galitzine and Taylor Zakhar Perez embody this unlikely and glamorous couple. Their chemistry works wonders in every scene, whether comic, dramatic or sensual. This film ends making you believing in eternal love, and that's exactly what you want from a romantic comedy. The revolution brought about by this mainstream movie is headlining an LGBTQ+ couple as a matter of course. But It took more than a century of cinema to do that.","Aug 20, 2023",audience_review

Given that the typical film spans only 90 to 100 minutes, it's unrealistic to expect every nuance of the book to be mirrored on screen. ‘Red, White & Royal Blue' masterfully rises to this challenge, standing as a stellar film in its own right and paying homage to its literary origins. It's fun, feel-good, and possesses sufficient depth to be appreciated as a work of art in its own right.","Aug 20, 2023",audience_review
"Red, White & Royal Blue",Craig S,"A very good movie based on a very good book by Casey McQuiston, with universal themes of love and prejudice. Love wins as does the movie. The two stars do an excellent job conveying the sensibilities of their characters: they do a very good job portraying the dislike-to-like-to-love relationship that grows. Their attraction to each other is portrayed in a believable way. Opposite's do attract - the writers and actors portray the complicated characters very well and make it work. At first it seems that Nicholas Galitzine's character is the more complicated and will be the center of attention. But the attention shifts to Taylor Zakhar Perez and his very exuberant and lovable character. And then it equals out during the hospital scenes including the almost necessary ‘closet' scene. Their obvious chemistry is what makes the romance real and heartwarming. As a gay member of the audience, it was quite pleasing to see the romantic scenes handled with passion and without being overly gratuitous. The love making scene (and we do still call it that) is both sensuous and sensual. It is portrayed in a very adult and mature way. The close-ups of the two men's faces relay precisely what each has to give the other and the love that is developing - it is masterfully done. The only other time I seen such a well done love-making scene was between Robert Redford and Meryl Streep in Out of Africa - very good company. The smile that Henry gives, with Alex in bed next to him after the romp in the museum tells you everything about where this character is and where he is going. Boy meets boy and they fall in love - obstacles try to block their love, but in the end their love triumphs. I thank them for making a perfectly delightful and corny love story between two men for us to enjoy. Well done - everybody involved is to be congratulated.","Aug 20, 2023",audience_review

The story moved wayyy to fast, it was cringe (as expected) and it should've been rated a 15 as the sex scenes and nudity isn't appropriate for a 12 year old kid. And I'm not hating bc it's LGBTQ bc I'm apart of that community and love almost every show with rep. The characters were well played and the actors did a somewhat good job, but it wasn't super believable either. The royal guys accent was too British (from a Brit lol). The film was hard to watch, ngl. I had to pause and stare at my screen in disbelief multiple times. I have not read the book, despite being a huge bookworm, so maybe I would've enjoyed more if I had read the book however, a family member did and told me it was rubbish (I trust her with everything) maybe watching it a second time will help, and after seeing a bit more stuff about it on social media I don't think it's as bad as I originally thought it was.

"Red, White & Royal Blue",Cory B,"I came into this movie knowing nothing about the story or the book upon which it was based, and was absolutely delighted by the experience. It is the witty rom-com I didn't know I needed in my life! The chemistry of the main characters - Nicholas Galitzine as Prince Henry and Taylor Zakhar Perez as Alex Claremont-Diaz - makes you want more of their relationship at the end of every scene. Director Matthew Lopez brings the story forward with both funny and sexy and tender moments that all ring true to new love - as well as a touch of theatrical whimsey, which keeps it in the fairy tale realm, heading toward a happily-ever-after ending (which in and of itself is so refreshing - a happy ending to a gay romance, rather than a tragic one). And the entire supporting case is outstanding. In particular, shout out to the hilarious Sarah Shahi as Zhara, calling-it-like-it-is-but-make-it-cute Rachel Hilson as Nora, and straight-faced-with-a-wink Aneesh Sheth as Amy. But all the characters come through as full people - strong and intelligent and diverse. It's a fun, sexy, touching, happy-ending romp, that I will gleefully be watching again and again!","Aug 18, 2023",audience_review

Madeleine Collins,N/A,"Gosh, this is definitely the crappiest French movie I have seen in the last couple of years. The story is so ridiculous that if the director wouldn't feed all the details tiny bit by bit and back and forth in the timeline you could actually shoot the movie compacted into 15 minutes instead of boring the spectators to death for 100 minutes.

Star Trek,Coop t,"Star Trek is an absolute classic, despite the drastic updates to the formula that director J.J. Abrams takes. For better or for worse, this isn't your mom and dad's Star Trek. Gone are the days where diplomacy and intelligence are used to solve problems. Instead, they often play out during thrilling action sequences that understandably have a lot of die hard Star Trek fans up in arms. That being said, I feel that Star Trek is greater than the sum of it's parts. It might be a bit too action packed and the film definitely discredits some of the key cornerstones of the Star Trek universe, but it succeeded in rebooting the franchise for a new generation, resulting in a critically lauded trilogy.","Sep 8, 2023",audience_review

Star Trek,Marc Z,"This reboot, and re-imagining, of a classic could have gone horribly wrong. It didn't. The visual mastery and smart casting choices would have been satisfying for 30 minutes has there not been more to this masterful undertaking. JJ Abrams did a great job paying homage to the cast, themes, storylines, and characters of the original series; however, he creates a world that the initiated can enjoy for what it is. His handling of the multiverse gives him the chance to alter some of the backstories, and that is ok-it works. The cast, from Chris Pines' Kirk to Saldana's Uhura are terrific. They all do a good job using their predecessors as a baseline, but making the characters their own. This story is NOT as good as the film that follows this, but it is interesting and lends itself to some great throwbacks.","Aug 27, 2023",audience_review
Star Trek,kev k,"I enjoy the actor's imitations of the real cast, but this is a badly thought through knock off. I'd call it cheap but they spent millions on this stuff. You'll be left wondering what they spent it on. Small point that really annoys me is Sulu pulling a katana. That means these people did not watch the original series and had no idea why Roddenberry called him that name. Sulu is not an East Asian family name, it's a small sea in the middle of the Eastern Pacific. Roddenberry told George Tokai that he wanted an Asian man on his bridge and he needed him to represent all Asians, not just Japan. In the episode Naked Time, a virus lowers the crews inhibitions and Sulu runs round the ship stripped to the waist with a cutlass. They tried to give him a katana but George pointed out that he grew up in the US watching pirate movies and so wanted to be a pirate that he joined a fencing club and learned swordplay. The producers agreed he could have a cutlass and George ran out and learned to fence because he had lied about that bit.

Why was there yelling and fighting throughout the ship, why was the engine room made to look like a modern factory, why was literally every aesthetic changed from previous generations of the Star Trek universe. The ships, weapons, uniforms, even the particle effects, are all stylized and seem to forget the original ideas that futuristic technology will be simpler.

Star Trek,TWMax65,"I was curious to check this out since it seemed like a neat sci-fi movie, however I was slightly hesitant since I've never seen a Star Trek movie before and I'm first and foremost a Star Wars fan. This was actually quite entertaining and not boring at all! You could really tell this was directed by J. J. Abrams which isn't a bad thing since he has a neat style. It may have lost me in a couple of parts with some of the material being quite a lot to process and there was one character that seemed unnecessarily annoying. Plus there were a lot of very convenient and unlikely occurrences with the plot too. Bust aside from that, there's not much wrong with this film! The visuals and production were great, the story never really slowed down and had a lot of good parts, the rivalry between Kirk and Spock gets you invested, the humor was done well with good spins, Zoe Saldaña looked beautiful and acted well, and the action scenes were hit out of the park! Definitely something I'd watch again, and Netflix should put the sequels up as well!","Nov 4, 2022",audience_review
Star Trek,Jace E,"Star Trek is an enjoyable space adventure for everyone. Whether you loved the original series/movies or never got into them, there is something for you in this film. The cast is excellent, the editing is superb (especially the sound) and the story is a solid introduction to the Star Trek universe. From the first scene, it is evident that this would be an emotional story. The character depth is sincere and it was fulfilling to see each member of the team take their rightful place on the Enterprise. While the original series is all about intellect, negotiations and ""Kobayashi Maru"" type scenarios, this film focused a little too heavily on the action. There were moments that felt more like a Power Rangers film than Star Trek. Overall, the film is one of the best reboots in recent history. Filled with daring action, a twinge of nostalgia (nothing like a few red shirts) and great characters, Star Trek is a strong starting point for the future of the USS Enterprise. Best Character: Kirk Best Scene: The opening sequence Best Quote: ""Pike made him first officer."" - Sulu, ""You gotta be kidding me!"" - Bones ""Thanks for the support"" - Kirk Best Piece of Score: ""Enterprising Young Men"" Additional Note: Hearing the original theme play as the credits rolled was spectacular, though I wish it was Kirk speaking rather than Spock.","Nov 3, 2022",audience_review
Star Trek,liam k,"The action movie that we've come to expect from J.J. Abram is here dressed as Star Trek. But don't worry, it's not dull and nerdy like Star Trek; instead, it's cool and sexy and makes little sense. Set pieces occur at random, much like in a video game! The effects are still quite fantastic, and occasionally you can see them through lens flares! Your favourite characters are all speaking some of the same lines! It manages to be just a little bit more troublesome than a genuine 1960s TV programme! ...as well as other such stuff. If you disregard what it's pretending to be, it's a punchy contemporary sci-fi movie that did so well that the director was given the opportunity to destroy another cherished sci-fi brand thereafter.","Oct 31, 2022",audience_review

Eppure, J.J. Abrams riesce a riportare in auge il brand di Star Trek; e lo fa prendendo spunto dagli aspetti migliori della trama del primo capitolo; soprattutto nella presentazione dei personaggi uno ad uno; ed aggiungendo degli effetti grafici veramente ottimi ed una trama che resta di spessore, così come lo era stata nel medesimo capitolo passato.

Star Trek,N/A,"This was the first lifesign of Star Trek after a few years of absence from TV screen and theaters. The last movie with the next generation crew, Star Trek Nemesis, was a weak send-off. At the same time Star Trek: Enterprise, after an improving 4th season, got an unworthy final episode. Fans were generally fine with the idea of a reboot, a fresh start under new leadership. So, this movie, Star Trek (2009), got a lot of goodwill and premature praise. Unfortunately, the movie is not good. At first, the decision to recast the original Enterprise crew and have them go on adventures that are completely incompatible with the original show and movies, was an obvious move to get as much attention as possible without actually working for it artistically. If the new movie was so different from anything we had seen before, why tag the names of the original crew on it? Yes, cheap cash grab. The story is nothing but a vehicle to glue action scenes and the appearance of original Spock (Leonard Nimoy) together. One could even say that the script is not just not good - it is plain stupid. The villain is just mad and poorly written. Nothing about him and his motivation makes sense. There is no reason to believe that his crew would blindly follow him for more than 20 years. Plus, why and where did they hide for that time period? Better not think about any of that too much. The action scenes - there were plenty of them, yes. I personally did not find them visually appealing. Fast cuts, colorful explosions. That's just my opinion. Visuals - the often referred lense flares are a nuisance. The general design of the Enterprise's interiors is a little too clean but I could live with that. The engine room looks like a brewery and does not tie in to the rest of the visuals. I don't know where they wanted to go with that. Casting - the actors are capable and, given a good script, could have carried the roles through a good movie. Especially Chris Pine is a perfect choice for Captain Kirk. This movie could have gotten away with a lot of its shortcomings if its successors were better. The first movie sets the stage for the new crew and needs to take time to introduce everyone. Just in itself, this movie proved that after the desaster of Star Trek Nemesis, there are still ways to go worse. What it mostly did was shine a light on the good aspects of previously considered bad Star Trek movies, mostly Final Frontier and Nemesis, which at least had a structure in their script and obvious attempts to explore deeper issues.","Apr 10, 2022",audience_review
Star Trek,stefano t,"I expected worse. It wasn't actually that bad, but still exaggerated in some of the characters' traits, which made it ridiculous. I'm still a huge Star Trek fan and of course it brought a tear to my face, but I really feel like they pushed too much trying to show us the characters particularities.","Apr 8, 2022",audience_review
Star Trek,kyle e,"While it was not a perfect series (William Shatner's overacting, less than great production values and an iffy Season 3), the original 'Star Trek' series was a genre landmark and hugely influential and ground-breaking, also a mostly great series in its own right especially for the characters, the relationships and Leonard Nimoy's Spock. The films based on the original series were a mixed bag. A few great ones with 'The Wrath of Khan', 'The Voyage Home' and 'The Undiscovered Country', one in-between film with 'The Search for Spock' and disappointments with 'The Motion Picture' and particularly 'The Final Frontier'. There were ten 'Star Trek' films before this 2009 reboot, four being based on the 'Next Generation series where the only outstanding one was 'First Contact'. 'Generations to me was another in-between film and 'Insurrection' and 'Nemesis' were two other particularly problematic ones. 'Star Trek' (2009) is neither one of the best of the films or one of the worst, if anything it's another in-between effort while being marginally better than the other two in-between films. There are a lot of impressive elements and some major flaws that stop it from being the great prequel that it had potential to be. Visually, the film mostly looks great. Particularly good is the set for the Enterprise which not only amazes visually but one of the elements that sticks close to the original series. The special effects are mainly fantastic and leave one in awe, while there is audacious and suitably moody cinematography and atmospheric lighting. By all means it is not perfect visually, there is the distracting overuse of lens flares that was in serious need of a toning down, it was a technique that was abused somewhat, didn't feel necessary in some scenes and is not particularly comfortable sometimes to look at. Michael Giacchino delivers another winner of a music score, don't remember ever being disappointed by this man. Sure it is familiar, but it fits very well with the film and its mood and is unmistakable Giacchino, a beautiful score to listen to and has a lot of atmosphere. There are some thought-provoking moments in the script and it doesn't feel too talky which is true in spirit to the original series. Where it doesn't fare so well is the comic relief, there is a little too much of it and some of it wasn't particularly funny and seemed superfluous as well. Regarding the story, 'Star Trek' (2009) evoked mixed reactions from me. It is rich in atmosphere and has some thrilling moments and truly exciting action, while the interplay between Kirk and Spock is brilliantly written and makes one feel quite nostalgic. Most of it is easy to follow. Less good are some bogus science, some parts that are convoluted and could have benefited from more explanation and Nero's plan and motivation being underdeveloped, confused and inconsistent. It is also too big and noisy in spectacle and could have quietened down to give room for more characterisation. One of the original series' strengths too was the characters and how they were developed and interacted, other than Kirk, McCoy and Spock there wasn't enough of that with most of them like Nero being far too one-dimensional. Casting is mostly good but with a couple of misses. Zachary Quinto in particular nails it as Spock with huge shoes to fill, capturing perfectly what was so iconic about the character in the first place. Another great contribution is a suitably cantankerous Karl Urban, who remains loyal to DeForrest Kelley's interpretation without being an impersonation. Chris Pine did very well and is certainly more subtle than William Shatner, the character isn't likable at first but evolves and Pine brings that out. Zoe Saldana is fiery and sexy and Bruce Greenwood is good fun. It was nice to see Nimoy again as Old Spock and brought a nostalgic and affectionate element. Bana has some menace and does his best, but there are admittedly far more interesting villains in other 'Star Trek' films. Not everybody works. Simon Pegg, who is usually a very entertaining guy, is beyond irritating comic relief with Scotty coming over as a caricature. Anton Yelchin has also given much better performances, he badly overdoes it as Chekhov. In conclusion, fun and impressive often but with some major flaws at the same time. Nothing comes over disastrously though. 6.5-7/10 Bethany Cox","Mar 17, 2022",audience_review
Star Trek,N/A,"I remember when this movie first came. I was excited to see a fresh reboot of the Star Trek franchise. Instead of a remake, we get something of a prequel. The beginning of Captain Kirk's career and how he met his crew. Unfortunately, the filmmakers make too many liberties in rewriting the Star Trek timeline. going so far as to blow up Spock's home planet Vulcan. And include a very desperate attempt to include Leonard Nimoy. The storyline gets a little too complicated halfway through the film so I'll keep it real brief here. Nero is from the future. His home planet is in danger and Leonard Nimoy's Spock promises to help solve the problems. He doesn't and the planet explodes. So Nero goes back in time to blow up Spock's home planet. Star fleet responds and attempts to stop him but fails. This really is a fun movie. And the action is exciting. More exciting than the original Star Trek movie. But there are a few things that I really don't like. I don't get why Nero has to go through time. And destroying the Vulcan planet just rewrites the whole Star Trek timeline. Leonard Nimoy returning as Spock takes the story away from the new cast. It's always fun to see cameos of the original cast, but that's all you should do, just a cameo. Don't include the original actor playing his original role, it just takes away from the new actors. Despite some scenes being a little too ""low budget TV drama"" Star Trek is a fun movie to watch at least once. Just don't expect a star trek movie. This is really something of its own. The idea is really fresh and new. Take the crew of the Starship Enterprise and show us the beginning of their careers and how they all met on one really crazy mission. I think J.J. Abrams' experience of making TV shows got in the way of making a great movie. It doesn't feel epic enough and some silliness occurs as if the writers got stuck in a corner and said ""Now what?""

Star Trek,N/A,"A fantastic film that helms fantastic CGI, a surprisingly moving story, and loads of action and humor packed fun, ""Star Trek (2009)"" stands as one of the best of the Star Trek films and sees J.

The story that is present flawlessly blends amazing visuals, great action, and extremely well-done humor. The emotional depth of this film was surprising and was something that I honestly was not expecting to be as well done as it ended up being. The only real issue I have is that the dialogue and plot can sometimes become predictable, however, it is a very nit-pick flaw.

Star Trek,N/A,"Star Trek is a stunning movie from almost all departments. There is never a dull moment in the film, which a lot of that credit goes to screenwriters Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman. Those two writers produced a strong narrative that balanced the action-adventure aspect with the heartfelt features perfectly. Plus, the clever twist in the second act of the film occurs quite cleverly. It never made the plot hard to follow. J.J. Abrams elevates the script to a more extraordinary level by inducing those scenes to life in such marvelous ways. Abrams was able to capture the tone and feel of the movie flawlessly. However, Abrams' vision remains damaged by editors Mary Jo Markey and Maryann Brandon. The two editors did a decent job when the action sequences were not happening. Though, once the action commenced, the editing became quite choppy. Yes, one could argue that the quick-cut editing signifies the frantic emotions of the characters. Yet, the audience still needs to be able to see what is going on. Plus, it lessens the remarkable cinematography by Dan Mindel at points. To accompany these prominent visuals is a distinguished cast. Chris Pine is astounding and makes James feel like your typical rebel hero. It does feel cliche at times, but Pine knows how to play with the character to make it feel authentic to this movie. Zachary Quinto is also commendably cast in the role of Spock, with his portrayal being a stand-out in the cast. Supporting cast members like Anton Yelchin and Simon Pegg round out the company in a vast way. Zoe Salanda is a solid addition to the lineup of actors, and she should have been used more in the film instead of just being the love interest between the two male leads as Saldana is a great actress. Another radiant aspect of the film is the out-of-this-world visual effects. The visuals on screen were stunning, and nothing ever looked tawdry or obviously fake. As for the costuming and makeup department, it felt a bit wishy-washy. Not in the way where it did not feel space-like, but more how it felt plain. The outfits worn by the people on the Enterprise make sense and fit the film. Yet, the Romulans looked cheap and run-down. Yes, their entire population was compromised and wiped out, but there are no defining characteristics. Overall, Star Trek is a popcorn flick that delivers more than is demanded. With the script balancing various tones of the movie perfectly and J.J. Abrams' vision being creatively stunning, the film lends itself to a wondrous adventure in space. The film does lose itself a bit in the editing, costuming, and makeup departments. Those are just not up to the highest standard needed in an action-science fiction film. However, Star Trek never fails to be an excellent movie and creates a spectacular watch. Read more reviews like this at postcreditreviews.com","Sep 25, 2021",audience_review

Star Trek,james m,"JJ Abrams' take on Star Trek is youthful and vibrant, infused with loads of energy and clever direction.

Each of the lead actors bring a new take on their roles as the bridge crew, whilst staying true enough to the original characters created by Roddenberry and the original cast to keep them recognisable. But there is also a lot that will annoy many hardcore Trek fans: the constant destruction of the Enterprise in explosions of fire (even the 1960s Enterprise had shields that worked); the water-based cooling system running through the engine room, clearly introduced as a pointless plot device; Abrams' overuse of lens flares and camera shakes and, above all, the unnecessary messing with the Star Trek timeline just to suit some lazy scriptwriting.

Star Trek,robert r,"Taking a brief detour into contrarian territory, I actually prefer the latter two Kelvin Timeline ""Star Trek"" films to this one. That's not to say 2009's ""Star Trek"" isn't damn entertaining, featuring solid action, effects and emotionality (I dare anybody to try getting and through that opening scene with Chris Hemsworth and Jennifer Morrison without feeling anything). There's something about the established character relationships and circumstances of ""Into Darkness"" and ""Beyond"" that really feel a lot more tight. Obviously, the point of this film was to show how Kirk met Spock, how Kirk met Bones, how Kirk met Scotty and so on, but some of it's a bit forced and clumsy, much like the obligatory (?) inclusion of several iconic phrases from the ""Star Trek"" canon — i.e. ""I'm giving her all she's got, captain,"" ""I'm a doctor not a __________,"" etc. Also, as someone who saw ""Into Darkness"" and ""Beyond"" first, there's an almost crippling lack of Scotty in this. Again, I understand the whole ""establishing the new canon"" thing and maybe that's just the Simon Pegg fan in me talking, but the movie only really started to feel aerodynamic once the entire gang was brought together. Still, ""Star Trek"" is an unmitigated success in breathing fresh life and panache into one of the sci-fi's genres longest running IP's.","Oct 23, 2020",audience_review

Star Trek,N/A,"It is as pointless as the female Ghostbusters remake (people were never angry at women). But rather were asking themselves. What is the point of a dumbed-down remake timeline for casuals instead of a hardcore REAL-sequel? Is a dumbed down Star Trek that doesn't add anything to the lore, the original Spock being there is poorly done in that the character could be removed and all would happen almost same. Even worse, JJ Abrams' Star Trek redux, removed all the things and themes that made it interesting in the first place. This resembles more Star Wars, which it shouldn't. I'm more of a Star Wars fan, but what makes Start Trek interesting is that it has a different feel. So by removing that uniqueness, J.J. Abrams' removed the one thing that made it interesting in the first place, is like getting a McDonald's burger on Burger King. I'd rather go to McDonald's in that case. J.J. Abrams' doesn't understand Star Trek, and judging by his 2 Star Wars, is clear he doesn't get Star Wars either. Please get him away from movies that include Star in the title. He caused unrepairable box office damage to both franchises for decades to come, he should be sued. I mean the actors and VFX are fine, and that's about it.

Star Trek,N/A,"The quintessential example of a perfect reboot. Everything fires on all cylinders, not least of all the electric and amusing acting, some rich kinetic photography, clever callbacks and nuanced emotion. Perhaps re-tutored the world in how to build artistically presented blockbusters, for a spell anyway. The film that made Star Trek cool. It was always fun, heartfelt and adventurous, but it wasn't all those things *and* cool. Abrams manages to make a gripping and fresh and pitch-perfect reboot with an equally pitch perfect cast. We don't see too little or too much of the prequel elements of Star Trek and there are enough clever references that it's not too cloying or befuddling to those new to Star Trek. The timeline altering is just an absolutely perfect idea and there's a real sense of classic movie magic and an ingenious modern spirit injected into this movie that makes it timeless and consistently excellent. The 4K UHD isn't a huge leap above the blu-ray in terms of image because it was a pretty fine entry as it was, but the sheer contrast between the lights and darks in this movie are eye-popping and colours are strong and nuanced without being overwhelming.","Feb 7, 2020",audience_review

Star Trek,N/A,"StarDate Log: 2009, Summer, 1 minute after watching JJ Abrams reboot of the Star Trek Franchise. WOW! There have been 2 films that I can recall in my life wherein my expectations walking into the theatre were so thoroughly exceeded when walking out. Die Hard and Star Trek (2009). I was not a big fan of tv screen action Bruce Willis before Die Hard, but a huge fan afterwards. As for Star Trek, I watched the TV shows growing up, but found them somewhat lacking - good - not overwhelming. As for the movies, I enjoyed The Wrath of Khan, but the others were just a time filler. HOWEVER, after the opening sequence of the new ""rebooted and reimagined"" Star Trek, in which SO much happened in so little time (and it literally did)..I got goose bumps as the Title Name slowly flashed on screen along while the music blasting and beating as loud and true as my heart. The next 2 hours were filled with humor, action, nostalgia, twists, and most importantly flat out great entertainment...from a Star Trek movie!! The new faces taking on age old names was seamless/refreshing. The plot is not as important as the plan...the plan was to put Star Trek up there with the likes of Star Wars (Ep. IV and V of course) and the art of doing something like that needed a bold and confident if not cocky hand. Enter JJ Abrams who knows what entertains him, and thus entertains much of masses. He genuinely cares of the experience of the movie goer. He wants you to be amazed and feel things you had not felt before or for a long time. Movie Magic. I really hope he had as much fun making this movie as I had watching it, which is probably not possible. Good Job Paramount-Bad Robot and all the fresh new faces of actors that really brought it hard.","Jan 18, 2020",audience_review

Been long established that Spock wasn't really this type of person she was in to, why not still have her with Scotty?? The Engine room was Epic compared to other versions, too many lens flares not sure what that was about. I laughed so hard at the Kobeoshi Maru scenario (A good laugh), it had been referred to so many times and to finally get to see it played out as to what he did was epic. Although I didnt care for the TRIAL bit, its canon that he was given a commendation for original thinking because of what he did, not punished. Some good casting choices, and the actors did their best with what was given to them but some odd story choices.","Dec 19, 2019",audience_review

Star Trek,levi n,"I am a fan of Star Trek, not quite a trekkie, but I have always watched and loved Voyager, and TNG show and all four movies. I was nonetheless excited to see this glorious movie from heaven in the cinema for the first time when I was 8 years old. At the time, I just loved big space battles with spaceships and aliens, but on rewatches, I realized that it is so much better than that, it is the story of a man who knew he wanted more out of life, but he didn't know how to live up to the expectations of his father. It is a brilliant story that honors the original characters, but also puts such a well made and unique twist on it all. Chris Pine killed it in this movie, giving his best performance to date, he was witty and charismatic, yet he also was hiding his true intellect that he naturally has; he breaks rules, drinks excessively, and sleeps with tons of women. This movie found this broken man and showed the story of how star-fleet has completely changed his life for the better, and I believe that his incredible work in this movie gave him a name in Hollywood. Zachary Quinto was really good as spock, and I think that he did a really good job putting logic everywhere, but also not being afraid to show his human side as well. I am glad to see the origins of Spock's life as well as Kirks and it makes it easier to care about both of them, while also telling an investing story Zoe Saldana was very good and she was developed better than most the other characters, she brought the strong female presence that will empower women and give them someone to cheer on. Bruce Greenwood is my personal favorite as Christopher Pike, he brings this nice veteran presence and does a great job at convincing Kirk to join star fleet, he had a purpose in the story that was clear and executed nicely. You have the others including Karl Urban, Anton Yelchin, John Cho, and Simon Pegg who I thought all gave good performances and made likable new versions of their characters, but we don't really get that much of them in this movie because this is about Spock and Kirk, with Pike and Uhura being main secondary characters. Eric Bana was good in this movie, but his character Nero was kind of forgettable, but he did have a good villain motivation set up which was nice. Leonard Nimoy can never go wrong in a Star Trek movie, he's a legend and was great here. The visual effects are stunning, the story is compelling, the characters are likable, and this was a fantastic reboot of a beloved franchise that needed a new spark. Great job JJ and great job Chris Pine.","Aug 20, 2019",audience_review

Star Trek,N/A,"After years of telling people why I like Star Trek they can see a film that puts the original series into full light. Star Trek follows the creation of the greatest crew to explore the far reaches of space. The opening scenes show us a dramatic and moving battle between the USS Kelvin and the time displaced ship Nerada. This battle introduces the villain Nero (Eric Bana) and shows us the birth of James Kirk. Jump ahead 25 years and we see Kirk (Chris Pine) and Spock (Zachary Quinto) take two different paths to Starfleet and the adventure to stop the vengeance filled Nero begin. Letï¿ 1/2(TM)s start with the amazing story. The script perfectly captured the characters, drama, terror, and passion of the franchise. One scene at the beginning of the film was so moving I had tears in my eyes. Just the beginning reveals the quality of what is in store for old Trek fans and the new ones to come. Star Trek does an amazing job of capturing everything that makes Star Trek brilliant. Being a crazed fan since childhood I tell you this film communicated all the qualities that make Star Trek great. While we Trekies get our fill the film does not turn off new fans and in fact shows them the charm and beauty of this franchise. Gone are the things that weighed down the last three Trek series (techno babble, the need for a deep understanding of TOS and TNG, etc). The actors were brilliant, perfectly capturing each character. I seriously felt like I was meeting old friends after years of their absence. Chris Pine was smart in not trying to imitate Shatner but was still able to show some of Shatners Kirk mannerisms. Quinto had a tough job playing Spock especially because Leonard Nimoy was also in the film playing an older Spock. Even with this mirror image Quinto played Spock perfect. The rest of the cast was fantastic especially Karl Urban playing McCoy. Nero as a villain was very shallow giving us little to invest in him but he did his job. The special effects are beyond description. The sheer beauty of it all was too much to take in on the first showing. Lucas needs to take lessons from these guys. Now, I know that many Star Trek fans hate this film. They say it is pure action flick nonsense which I find ridiculous. I agree that the tv show was much deeper sci-fi but the Trek movies have all been closer to action films. The beloved Wrath of Khan is an action film with no true deep sci-fi themes like the tv show. Despite fan nitpicks this is a great film that is an amazing relaunch of the original Star Trek.","Apr 2, 2019",audience_review

I know that this is not the ""original"" Star Trek, but it did an amazing job introducing a new viewer to an already established franchise.

The only reason Im not saying really good characters is because the characters arent the same as they used to be and in my opinion the actors do not fit the characters a lot of the time. Though I think that the actors dont fit there characters they are still very good actors. Very good music that fits the scenes very well. Good story even though there are a few cliches.

Star Trek,N/A,JJ Abrams is the destroyer of fan-bases. He was given permission to destroy a franchise for the sake of the parent company being able to receive all future profits from merchandise. They had to destroy the previous history and rewrite to the extent that they could cut out Paramount from future profits/rights. In doing so this version of Star Trek is dead to me. It was trash.,"Dec 4, 2018",audience_review
Star Trek,N/A,Thank goodness this movie was good. I really liked it and I think its better than all of the original series (besides Wrath of Khan).,"Oct 24, 2018",audience_review

Star Trek,N/A,J.J Abrams doesn't understand Star Trek and doesn't care to in this blatant slap in the face to any fan of Star Trek pre reboots. I describe this film as Fast n Furious in space. And it sucks.,"Oct 14, 2018",audience_review
Star Trek,N/A,"This is the reboot that needs to be applauded-JJ Abrabs has made a film that will entice new fans and at the same time not offend Trekkies. All the new actors adapt themselves to iconic roles and the special effects are low key but fantastic. Of course, the main question is- will new fans like it, or even understand the lore? Yes, they will.","Oct 7, 2018",audience_review
Star Trek,N/A,"While the casting and performances are excellent, rebooting star trek by trying to turn it into star wars just didn't cut it for me.","Oct 6, 2018",audience_review
Star Trek,N/A,"Star Trek is an unnecessary reboot in my opinion. JJ Abrabs is a talented filmmaker and it is easy to see his enthusiasm (he is almost like a fanboy giddily recreating all his favorite childhood movies) and rigor but the reboot and especially the cast will always suffer from comparison with the original TV series. Furthermore, although the film is interesting and gets everything sorted- in as much as one can in less than 2 hours- there is a rushed feeling to the proceedings. The special effects are good but we've seen it all by now, the razzle and dazzle only goes so far. The Star trek reboot isn't a bad film as much as an unneeded one.(Only watch if you are a Trekkie).","Oct 4, 2018",audience_review
Star Trek,N/A,"Not big fan of reboots to begin with, but the cast of this movie did a fantastic job of emulating the original characters of the TV show and movies. The plot was okay, but not terrible, on par with ST: Nemesis. There were a few WTF moments where the comedy fell flat. My #1 issue was the excessive lens flares. Those lens flares are really the only thing keeping this film from getting 4 stars.","Oct 2, 2018",audience_review
Star Trek,N/A,"This wasn't necessary- I can understand the desire of uber fanboy director JJ Abrabs but this wasn't needed. The legendary science fiction series has enough fodder to last generations. This just pisses me off so much I want to strangle someone just because of the detoriated essence of most Human Beings. JJ is what the Hollywood Industry does not need. He is the reason groups such as MGTOW(Men Going Their Own Way) and in politics far right groups all across the western world(and reverberating throughout the world)are getting more and more numbers of young primarily white, but men of all races in the last few years or so. This pussification of men as more and more in mainstream society become pansies and pussies is indirectly responsible for this project when the reason why it would be needed at all should be common sense. Furthermore, although the film is interesting and gets everything sorted- in as much as one can in less than 2 hours- there is a rushed feeling to the proceedings. The special effects are good but we've seen it all by now, the razzle and dazzle only goes so far. The Star trek reboot isn't a bad film as much as an unneeded one.","Sep 20, 2018",audience_review

The Menu,Michael Clark,"This movie isn’t for everyone. It’s intense, unforgiving, and pulls no punches. The filmmakers attack the anti-hoi polloi here with the precision of a brain surgeon’s scalpel and show no quarter in the process.","Nov 22, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Peter Gray,"A film that owns its pretentiousness and is best served to patrons unaware of what they’re about to ingest, The Menu is a dark, twisted delight enhanced by the first-class sparring between Fiennes and Taylor-Joy.","Nov 22, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Sara Michelle Fetters,"The line between serf and nobleman slowly disappears with the delivery of each course to a guest’s table, which only augments how dazzlingly unhinged this madness proves to be.","Nov 22, 2022",critic_review

The Menu,Robert Denerstein,"A study in austere modernism, restaurant Hawthorne isn't just a place to eat, it's the physical embodiment of rarified consumer aspiration...","Nov 22, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Frank Swietek,"A black comedy that skewers the capitalist class divide through the prism of pretentious haute cuisine....has some succulent ingredients but in the end, like so many haute cuisine servings, it leaves you hungry for something more substantial.","Nov 21, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Louisa Moore,"The disappointing ending falls short of the devilish deliciousness that comes before, but ""The Menu"" is a wickedly savage, genre-blending thriller that provides arthouse fun for foodies.","Nov 21, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Joshua Mackey,"This beautiful dish of a movie is refreshing, smart, and fun and best served in this dark comedy thriller fashion.","Nov 21, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Tori Preston,Perhaps the highest compliment I can offer The Menu is simply that I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it. The film is as well executed and as emotionally distant as the very food it depicts.,"Nov 21, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Carson Timar,The Menu is food that looks better as a social media post than an actual meal with a surprising lack of follow-through and purpose when one peels back even the initial layer of what the film presents.,"Nov 21, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Amelia Harvey,"Ultimately, The Menu isn’t telling us anything we don’t already know. The digs are surface level, the characterisations somewhat heavy-handed, but the script is sharp and darkly funny enough to get away with it.","Nov 21, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Dennis Harvey,"A half-baked breadstick posing as haute cuisine, this movie is neither filling, nor as slyly sophisticated as it pretends to be.","Nov 21, 2022",critic_review

The Menu,Sara Clements,"From amuse-bouche to the most epic dessert, Mark Mylod’s The Menu delivers a feast that increases in both heat and flavor as the film descends into chaos. It’s both a savory ode to the culinary world and a spicy takedown of the rich.","Nov 21, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Alci Rengifo,"It may be snarky, but “The Menu” is also elegantly entertaining.","Nov 21, 2022",critic_review

The Menu,Jason Best,"Initially, the target of the satire being served up by British director Mark Mylod... appears to be the fussy pretensions of high-end fine dining... Behind the comedy, however, something darker is going on.","Nov 19, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Patrick McDonald,"The archetypes never rise above their easy-target personalities, & that is the main problem. It lacks a theme or centerpiece, except to point there are Weird foodies! Vain movie stars! Wealthy people without morality! Which is what everyone already knows","Nov 19, 2022",critic_review

The Menu,Nick Hilton,"If the film’s raison d’etre is to show up the vapidity of modern art, then it produces no argument better than itself. Dumb but delicious, The Menu is a feast for the senses, if not the brain.","Nov 18, 2022",critic_review

The Menu,Kevin Maher,"The Willy Wonka storyline is aped here, as one naughty guest after another faces up to their fate in a thinly disguised morality play.","Nov 18, 2022",critic_review
The Menu,Ryan Syrek,"Like a dumber, drunken Midsommar, instead of insights into trauma/romantic vs communal love, it stumbles and slurs its words, yelling “No, you know what? You’re ALL jerks!” It’s not wrong… It’s fun to hear sloppy rants about obvious injustices sometimes.","Nov 18, 2022",critic_review

The Menu,Derek Deskins,"For much of the film's runtime, it is immensely enjoyable. [...] But when ""The Menu"" sets out to give itself meaning, to be more than an alternatingly funny and upsetting horror-comedy, it struggles to find its footing.","Nov 18, 2022",critic_review

The Menu,Charles Koplinski,"Deliciously wicked, Mark Mylod’s “The Menu” gleefully skewers elitism in all its forms, laying waste to the pretentious and privileged with abandon...one thing’s for sure – after watching it, you’ll never look at S’mores in the same way again.","Nov 18, 2022",critic_review

The Menu,Christian W,"Great acting, but action couldn't support its directorial aspirations. Some stock characters brought the interest level down, like the critic-as-bad-guy.

The Menu,paul s,"Dark, dysfunctional and totally nails the current cultural phenomenon and preoccupation with celebrity chefs. Comical and yet disturbing, may not be to everyone's taste, but we found it to be clever and totally different from the mind-numbing onslaught of drivel from Hollywood. It didn't preach at me or lecture me it entertained in a darkly wicked way and thank goodness for Ralph Fiennes and Anya Taylor-Joy who can act without scrunching their eyebrows (Nick Hoult is fine as the uber-foodie).","Dec 20, 2022",audience_review

Fiennes never fails to deliver on the cold-hearted intellectual psycho role (but one you also cannot fail to find sympathetic) and The Menu is no exception! Anya Taylor-Joy once again nails the role of beauty AND brains- with a tough-girl twist! And finally- oh, the delightful satire of watching this all in San Francisco! I felt like I was at French Laundry with Newsom and London Breed during that tasteless display of smug dinner during Covid! Highly recommend!","Dec 19, 2022",audience_review
The Menu,TERRIKA C,"If you happen to love art, food, and culture...stay home. This is a love song to those of us in the Service industry. This is for those who have strayed from their original narrative, being lost to the hype of making money and leaving art behind. This was everything: witty, thought provoking, daresay comedic at times. Anthony Bourdain would have approved.","Dec 19, 2022",audience_review

The Menu,Eric,an awesome twisted flick. great performances from the entire cast and the tension that builds throughout is perfectly set and it becomes more and more evident what is happening as the guests realize why. Ralph fiennes is perfect and commands his kitchen with a unnerving fervor that becomes continuously more unsettling with every course.,"Dec 18, 2022",audience_review

The Menu,James A,"This movie was different from any movie I've seen in a very long time. It was not your run of the mill horror movie, not a slapstick comedy, not even too much drama and thankfully very definitely not a super hero movie. The movie almost exclusively takes place in a restaurant where the chef is, well....different and a little unsatisfied with his life and his customers. How he handles each course and customer is what makes this movie fun and interesting to watch. This movie is not for everyone, but it was pretty good overall.","Dec 17, 2022",audience_review

The Menu,Leigh,"I wish it would have been disclosed in the movie overview and a warning about a suicide in the movie. My brother shot himself through the mouth last year. Seeing that occur in this movie was extremely difficult for me. Now Im having to process through the pain again. With the amount of suicides and people struggling and thinking of it, there NEEDS to be an obvious WARMING about it in the overview and on the screen prior to the movie starting. If there is something I can do to make this happen, I hope I can learn how to.","Dec 14, 2022",audience_review

The Menu,Dominic,Such a good movie. Serious at times but also injects a bit of comedy in where needed.,"Dec 12, 2022",audience_review
The Menu,Lisbeth Coiman,"The cast is outstanding and the acting superb. There were parts of the plot line that were like commentaries of the movie (""it's so theatrical,"" the food critic would say.) I love the conflict of the artist in the face of criticism. I loved how the snobby/disrespectful/indifferent audience, the money laundry operations of the investors in the production of art(cooking). All this is the realm of art exemplified in the art of a chef. And that's great. The only character who understands the artist and is able to give an honest, unbiased, reasonable opinion is the one that doesn't want to be there, doesn't care for the show, the absurdity of this pretentious audience. However, the film is a bit too long, unnecessary gruesome, and the comedy is lost to the darkness of the situation. It would have had a better effect on me without so much blood, 1/4 hour less, and more comedy or no comedy at all. Let's say is heavy on the horror and bland on the comedy.","Dec 12, 2022",audience_review

The Menu,Meghan,"Dark and enthralling, keeps you guessing. Love some of the reveals","Dec 10, 2022",audience_review
The Menu,Jennifer C,"IMO, this movie was roughly two hours of triggers that I doubt anybody really needs. The film tried desperately to be profound, but ultimately the story didn't feel very original. To be fair, the premise was interesting and there were a few scattered moments of brilliance. It seemed pointlessly dark, however, and not clever enough to be a true dark comedy. I had much migher hopes.","Dec 10, 2022",audience_review

Good character development, understandable story, excellent acting and great CGI, I found myself purchasing tickets for a second round at the theater.

Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,Billy,"I'm not sure where all of these ""glowing reviews"" are coming from. One of two sources comes to mind: Paid Reviewers or People with extremely low standards regarding 'entertainment' How was the movie? Predictable. Every step of the way. The characters are shallow, with a typical tragic boo-hoo-hoo backstory. We have: - The charming main character who is a boyish rogue and witticism abound - The feisty warrior female ""clan"" member who is stand-offish but has a heart of gold - The bumbling inept mage who only can perform when it's do-or-die - And the druid (?) who is cold because she's been rejected everywhere...except her adopted ""home"" ....and these four manage to band together somehow, with no real sense of connection. But, hey, yeah, they're gonna break into a vault to steal something with a plan that has more holes in it than swiss cheese. Oh, did I forget to mention the ridiculously stereotypical ""bad guy?"" And the transparent-as-glass red mage?' Let's not forget the daughter of our boyish rogue main guy who adds absolutely nothing to the ensemble except as a weak and unresolved plot device. The whole movie was predictable, beginning to end, no shocks, no surprises, no ""Oh, wow!"" People finding this movie to be a ""Gee, golly, that was great!"" are in love with CGI versus good acting and a believable plot arc. Now, the good news.... This is just as believable as a real AD&D tabletop campaign, save the over-the-top CGI. And, this movie is far better than the laughingstock that came out around twenty years ago. However, this was nothing exciting that hasn't been seen numerous times minus the ""Dungeons and Dragons"" moniker. Pass on this until you get it streaming all I did was waste 25 minutes worth of previews and 2 hours and 5 minutes on a 'movie' that I predicted the ending 30 seconds in.","May 14, 2023",audience_review
Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,Eric,"Although I have never personally had the chance to play Dungeons & Dragons I do own quite a few of the books.

Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves,Ron,"This was such a well done movie. Chris Pratt at his best with wit, humor, and intelligence... along with all other cast members that each gave the best of their unique character. Love when they let a band of adventurers find their own contribution to the story line, no one dominating. Everyone was so good. Plus, the culture of D&D being about the group you assembled to win... man, they nailed it.","May 14, 2023",audience_review

I love Dungeons & Dragons and this is a perfect representation of what it's like to play a tabletop campaign. It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it isn't just a big joke either. It was a perfect mix of serious, funny, emotional, and heartfelt moments. I can assure you there will be both laughter and tears, and you will be doing a whole lot of smiling throughout the movie. Chris Pine, Michelle Rodriguez, Reg-Jean Page, Justice Smith, Sophia Lillis, Hugh Grant, Daisy Head, and Chloe Coleman all did a great job portraying their characters and made the movie better for it. The effects, both practical and CG, greatly enhanced the movie and there were some amazing landscapes and sets portrayed too. All in all, this is a must watch film for anyone looking to have a great time whether you're a fan of D&D or not. I would also highly recommend reading the two prequel novels, Druid's Call and The Road to Neverwinter, too since they go deeper into the characters' origins and motivations, which really enhanced my enjoyment and made me feel a deeper connection with each of them.","Apr 25, 2023",audience_review

The Stranger,Keith C,"The Stranger simply put is a beautifully shot movie, with a great score and amazing acting. However, this movie is also very slow and mostly boring, so much so, that I found myself struggling to get through it. I was expecting so much more from such a highly rated and praised film but sadly found myself confused, frustrated and even annoyed at times. Confused because I don't understand the praise, frustrated because this movie is one of the worst sound mixed movies I've ever seen/heard, and annoyed because I was then forced to use subtitles because I could literally not hear majority of the dialogue. The movie overall felt rushed in the story telling department. We're just thrusted into the undercover agent picking up the accused killer and befriending him. Other people said the tension was great but I failed to see any real tension between the pair. More like a couple awkward moments and the suspect being a little odd and that's about it. Anyway, this is by no means a terrible film but it falls a little short of being average for me. Bad sound mixing and being slow/boring really took me out of the movie and hurts it's overall rating, I sadly can't recommend this one.","Jun 9, 2023",audience_review
The Stranger,Dawn B,"Wow! Quietly told but with quietly immense impact. With so many filums using special effects and being action-packed, this was almost a masterpiece of understated determination. It drew me in having to use subtitles, and that is not to put it down. 8.6/0.","Jun 6, 2023",audience_review

The Stranger,David M,"I really enjoyed this - a tense, beautifully made, subtle crime drama with a couple of brilliant central performances that has a lot going on beneath the surface. I was at times confused - and this will sound silly - by finding it hard to tell the difference between the two central characters. That may have been deliberate, reaching into the deeper themes of the films, but it was too much the case for me, and it caused me to lose the narrative thread at times. But otherwise, this feels like a film that has flown under the radar and that deserves more praise than it's received - and tells a story that is ultimately genuinely surprising.","Apr 25, 2023",audience_review

Overall the ratings are too high as a ‘entertaining experience', I think that's the main problem. It was really well made but that when all is said and done after some googling you find out the movie never really should have been made. Great artistry but that's about it. Definitely don't watch it with your wife. Hope that helps.","Apr 16, 2023",audience_review
The Stranger,Eugene W,"The Stranger is a gripping, philosophical novel that challenges readers to question their own beliefs about morality and human nature.

The Stranger,Jim B,"This movie does the moody crime drama really well, but for those who would watch just based on ratings alone, beware - it's a slow burn, and there's no real twists or turns - it just leads you slowly to the sad, dark place that it advertises up front, and then just soaks you in that somber darkness. So if that's your cup of tea, enjoy. For me, I was a little irked I didn't read the reviews more closely.. this type of sad movie is not for me, even though I do appreciate its artistry.","Apr 10, 2023",audience_review

The Stranger,Lorie F,Intense. Extremely well acted. I would watch it again.,"Mar 14, 2023",audience_review
The Stranger,Ben D,"This is a dramatized accounting of a real-life, 8-year cold case concerning the murder of a teenage boy in Queensland, Australia. The plot was doomed from the beginning. Because the family of the real-life victim, understandably, wanted nothing to do with the movie, the director focused on the undercover sting operation to catch the suspect (Sean Harris), immediately introduced, instead of the typical crime thriller where the killer's identity is (at least ostensibly) unknown. Once the details of the 2003 crime are revealed, there's no chance that the entirety of the plot would remain on Peter (Harris) and have him not be the killer. This takes the thrills out of the ""thriller"" genre. Without any flashback scenes of the victim or introducing his family, it becomes difficult to care about justice being served. The operation itself — wherein pretty much everyone but Peter is an undercover officer — deserves highlighting and celebration. However, the machinations the police created to elicit the confession would best be served in a documentary style.","Mar 8, 2023",audience_review

The Stranger,Ian W,"Not for the first time, the Audience gets it right. OK, an interesting covert Police operation. But, it has to be at least 30mins longer than it needs to be. Based on a true story - but difficult to believe the lengths the Police went to. Maybe not much serious crime in Australia. And if it was based on true events - why was there not the obligatory 'real life update' at the end of the film. It all finished very quickly and left this viewer short changed. 6/10.

Highly recommend and hope Australian cinema can keep delivering excellent films like this.","Feb 12, 2023",audience_review
The Stranger,Paul A,"As ""The Stranger "" (2022 release from Australia; 116 min) opens, we are introduced to Paul and Henry, 2 strangers who strike up a conversation on an overnight bus drive (think Greyhound). They gain each other's trust, and at Paul's invite, Henry joins him for an unspecified job Paul must do for Mark. ""No violence!. Pleads Henry, and he agrees to join us. At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie. Couple of comments: this is the second feature from Australian actor-turned-director Thomas Wright. Almost from the get-go I found something very David Lynch-like about this movie. Yes, nominally it's about a long ago disappearance, likely murder, of a young man. But it's the journey along the way that really matters in this film. I had the hardest time figuring out what was really going on for a long time. BEWARE: it is imperative that you turn on the English subtitles to fully grasp what is happening. I made the mistake of starting without the subtitles and within 10 minutes realized I was missing half the dialogue, if not more. I restarted the movie with subtitles and that turned out to be a life saver. The movie is mysterious all the way up to the end, and I absolutely loved it. The only ""star"" that I recognized was Joel Edgerton (as Mark), and he was superb. I fully recognize that this movie is not for everyone, as there is not a lot of ""action"". Instead it's a mystery that reveals itself, layer upon psychological layer. ""The Stranger"" premiered at this year's Cannes Film Festival to critical acclaim. Still it bypassed US theaters altogether, and it started streaming on Netflix a few months ago. Netflix suggested it to me based on my viewing habits. Good move Netflix. If you are in the mood for a dark psychological crime drama from Down Under, I'd readily suggest you check this out and draw your own conclusion.","Feb 11, 2023",audience_review

At the beginning of the film, everything seems normal as two men happen to meet each other on the bus, and as the story develops you find out that everything that is happening is a part of a large investigation.

The Stranger,dan r,"'The Stranger' is an intense mix of genres which will disturb many viewers. The film is now available on Netflix. SYNOPSIS: 'Mark, an undercover cop, forms an intense, intimate relationship with Henry, a murder suspect, in an attempt to earn his trust and get a confession, risking both of their lives in the process.' The darkness of this film's tone means that the story at times appears troubled with it taking a considerable amount of time to work out what's actually happening. This is a gloomy and dirty world, one which you'd never want to find yourself in. The lead characters are distrustful, brutal, and unhinged in their own ways. 'The Stranger' delivers strong but subtle performances from lead actors Edgerton and Harris. Proof that both actors have been wasted in their previous work in supporting roles. Disturbing but brilliant. 8/10","Jan 8, 2023",audience_review

The Stranger,N/A,"Overall, filled with flawless and impressive performances from both Joel Edgerton and Sean Harris, The Stranger is deeply unsettling, dramatic, and highly enjoyable, especially for those who love a crime story based on true events within Australia. The dramatic story creates on-screen tension and drama, especially when combined with a haunting soundtrack and daunting sound effects. In my opinion, this film doesn't have flaws or faults, even in its storytelling or pace, and thankfully, there's a level of respect towards the Morcombe case here. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen—highly recommended whether you know the entirely true story or not.","Dec 31, 2022",audience_review
The Stranger,michael c,"Snooze fest. You know a movie is boring and confusing when you remember details of the main character's beard better than the plot. They must have few murders in Australia if the police can spend so much manpower on a convoluted plan to get a coerced confession. A plan.

I had no idea what the film was about. 25 minutes in I was saying ""Holy Sh**."" This is a slowly paced, layered, taut and atmospheric crime thriller based on a true story. Sean Harris lights up the screen. The movie builds a terrifying intensity. Believe the high reviews. The low reviews are from people who either weren't able to follow the film, aren't a fan of this style of film, or perhaps don't know the actors, particularly Sean Harris. If you like the leads you will drink it up. Admittedly it has a mysterious unlayering of the plot, but if you pay close attention it is very rewarding. I also found the conclusion satisfying, which literally culminates in the very last shot.","Dec 12, 2022",audience_review

Right away, I could tell there was just some weird editing choices that I didn't really understand. It's like they were trying to make you feel creeped out but it doesn't work. The plot feels lifeless and it just moves along without keeping me engaged. To be completely honest I had no idea what was going on.

The Stranger,wayne m,"The Stranger is a taut, dark, atmospheric film that is slowly gripping and quite intense. It's a film that slowly peels aways the layers with quite great effect. It is based on the true life story of Daniel Morcombe, who was kidnapped and eventually murdered. After many years his killer was finally caught. This film begins with the audience not knowing where the story will go. Henry Teague is a loner who is brought into the fold of a crime family by 'Mark Frame'. But eventually we realise that Frame and the whole crime outfit are actually undercover police and their sole purpose is to draw information out of Henry and thus gain evidence of the murder they suspect he committed. The tone of this film is dark and intense, with a great score heightening the drama. Joel Edgerton and Sean Harris are superb in the lead roles.

No one could offer any more than the combination of Joel Edgerton and Sean Harris under the direction of Tom Wright and their producers. This is a seriously dark, genuinely creepy crime flick (bordering on horror) that's a fictionalized story about something terrible that was unfortunate enough to have really happened in Australia. If anyone can watch this without their blood running cold several times, they're cold blooded to begin with.","Nov 5, 2022",audience_review

The Stranger,dave d,"'The Stranger' is a great concept with some tangents that don't work. It's a well-acted movie experience, but what the heck is everyone worrying about. The third act didn't work, but the journey was enjoyable. The dream sequences and the fast resolve come out of nowhere and are tension amplifiers. There is enough of a build to the story, that we didn't need a reminder of the stakes. Joel Edgerton does his best, but his character is mostly one-note. The mental health aspect of the cop either has to be all-out or left off the page. Another pass or two could have been used and that homosexual tension would have made a lot more sense. What made this the highest profile case in Australia' history? Writer and Director Tom Wright never tells us. What a letdown, from what could have been a great film. Final Score: 6.4/10","Nov 2, 2022",audience_review

The Stranger,Kevin L,"The Stranger is a truly fine piece of filmmaking by director/screenwriter Thomas Wright. More and more I find myself using both those titles for the same person in reviewing quality films. It goes to show how much more effective a movie can be when being directed by the same person who wrote most or all of the screenplay. Who has more of a grasp of the concepts, themes, ideas and how to bring them to life on the screen than the writer? Wright's work is one of an assured and confident filmmaker working with a crew that was able to bring to life a movie that is at once taut, uniform in tone and slow burn intensity. The use of sound effects together with the score create a sonic landscape that grips, shakes, manipulates the viewer into feeling the fear, the high stakes danger, and the sense of the inevitable closing in on Henry. Credit also to the set direction and overall production design. The casting of Edgerton and Harris was exceptional. The two have such strong chemistry together, as one would expect from such standout veteran actors. Harris' whole look and demeanor is one that is equal parts shady and shaken. Edgerton walks the line between hardened knockabout criminal and undercover man. The pacing of the film is deliberate and purposeful. The film does feel especially slow at points, but there's no need to rush anything here. To do so would actually taint the realism and authenticity, so settle in and watch as the details unfold and the trap is set and executed. Fine work indeed- 3.8 stars","Nov 2, 2022",audience_review

The Stranger,wayne k,"Based on a case of child abduction and murder that I don't remember ever hearing about, The Stranger features stellar work from Sean Harris and Joel Edgerton, a man I genuinely didn't know was Australian until reading about this movie, and tells it's story in a slow yet still compelling way. The fragmented narrative can be disadvantageous at times, such as spoiling the twist surrounding Edgerton's character, but it keeps you informed as to what's going on and the players involved, even if many of them serve essentially the same function. Harris has made a career out of playing outcasts and oddballs, and he always brings a quiet intensity to the characters he plays. The matter-of-fact manner with which he recounts his crimes is a perfect demonstration of just how dark and disturbed he truly is. The film can feel monotonous and repetitive at times, since its essentially a police procedural, and there's very few moments of lightness or levity, so don't expect to be left smiling when it's over. It won't be the most striking or memorable film you'll see all year, but I'd say it's still worth a look.","Oct 28, 2022",audience_review
The Stranger,loo p,"The victims of this crime requested this movie not be made. It's been made to make money of a child's death. Daniel's (the actual child's name) is used for an amazing purpose educating children on how to stay safe. This movie goes against everything the parents stand for…poor show Joel, you should know better. This story was about the last ditch effort of law enforcement to convict the offender but mostly retuning the body of Daniel to his parents. And his parents did not agree to this movie. So they just changed the name of the victim and the offender so there was no need for their approval. Shame on you Joel. Day for Daniel was today, 28 October.

The Stranger,Michelle V,"Unbelievable. Incredibly moving. Ignore the people who say the following; ‘the less you know about the true case the better' (absolute bs), they were ‘lost' and couldn't follow, ‘nothing happens' or it was ‘predictable' - these people are absolute imbeciles and nothing more. They clearly can't follow a decent movie so you cannot respect their review. Those people likely think Jaws was realistic, y'know? They're definitely not parents, that's for sure. Anyhow, this is one of the most life changing and deeply affecting movies I've ever seen. The last two final scenes will never leave me. The way he puts his hand up… the way he cries. And the son finally understanding his father. Joel Edgerton will never be the same in my eyes. His performance was unlike any other - such a subtle yet truly impactful performance. I wish the real parents of Daniel would actually watch - I read they said they can't. I truly understand and empathise with that. But it was done so respectfully and they left that poor beautiful child out of the story while still being able to tell it, and have the victory of catching that sadistic pos killer. For the first time in my life, I genuinely value the work the police do. I haven't stopped crying since I finished watching 15 minutes ago. I'll never get over this movie - it's unlike any other and worth every minute, every second. Breathtakingly good. Absolute must watch.","Oct 26, 2022",audience_review
The Stranger,Kyle C,"Not what I think of as a typical crime drama. No shoot-outs, car chases, or Captains yelling at subordinates to find the killer. This , I believe, is one of the main reasons it was so good. It's was slow and deliberate, yet it was never boring. It wasn't an edge of your seat thriller by no means, but I felt tense the whole time. It lets you see, if only a little, what lengths detectives can go through to catch a killer. It also shows you the physical and mental toll they can go through. It was a very well made movie with a great cast, but I feel like the acting didn't matter as much as the feel of the story, since there wasn't really a lot of conversation between the two main characters. It's definitely worth watching if you even remotely like crime, drama, or both.","Oct 26, 2022",audience_review

Together, Edgerton and Harris' partnership works on so many levels, to deliver this dark, moody, quietly raging, visceral tale based on the abduction and murder of Daniel Morcombe. It feels sluggish at times, as the investigation unfolds, but these moments don't detract from the story or the on screen talent.

The Stranger,diane,"The movie of the century ! Two hours long and I was sorry when it ended. Only the Australians with their origins as a penal colony could have produced a work of art like this one. There is no other film in it's genre that can even come close to it and thus the bar has been raised to unattainable levels. Almost midway in there's an amazingly macabre demonstration on the part of the lead that reveals the inner essence and depths of a psychotic personality and yet there is no blood, no gore and no violence. I had to watch this scene over and over again and pause it as well. This cinematic moment will leave you with your jaw dropped and marks this actor as one of the finest of our time. The intensity is unrelenting and yet somehow, because it's mixed with such pathos, it's really quite bearable and even addictive.","Oct 23, 2022",audience_review
The Stranger,Samantha H,"Oh my gosh, I was hooked from the start, such fabulous storytelling, the slowness of the plot others describe here was to me, building and building the suspense, the use of metaphoric scenes, blank screens, changes in timeframes - was exhausting, but i was transfixed.

Wright's peculiar style of narration, unraveling the story in a somewhat unconventional style, actually amplifies the impact the story leaves on the audience. As for the score and cinematography, a better job couldn't have been possibly done as the atmospheric style totally suits the storyline. Even though Joel Edgerton delivers an acceptable performance as a character living a dual life, one must admit that it is Sean Harris who carries the whole movie with his nuanced yet powerhouse delivery.

Why are women such prudes!! This film is simply about escapism, with some erotica thrown in for good measure. Personally, I thought the sex scenes were pretty well done and relatively convincing. But who wouldn't want to be taken away from the day to day grind and given a life of luxury, wealth, love, good sex, travel and stunning good looking man - although perhaps not kidnapped.

He's playing Massimo very convincing, a charakter which is dominant but still knows what he wants. The whole Mafia story isn't bad. But at the end it's just a tipically dream of a woman who wants a sexy strong and bad boy, with money, sex, cars, sexy clothes and a perfect life. It isn't real at all.

365 Days,james w,"""Let's try something new and unexpected,"" we said. ""This looks steamy and just a bit trashy,"" we said. ""Let's watch this,"" we said. Clearly, we need to rethink our Netflix process. If movies could be those cheap 99-cent Kindle porns all about tattooed alpha billionaires railing virginal ingenues who find they like it a lot, ""365 Days"" would still be a few steps down. From the bizarre premise (""I'll give you 365 days to fall in love with me"") to the glorification of organized crime and masculine toxicity, this had everything objectionable I could think of in an erotic film. We watched to the end because you can't look away from a train-wreck, and it was fascinating to see what sort of walk of shame the movie was going to bring about. Hint: it was worse than we could have imagined. The stars are as gorgeous as the covers of the aforementioned potboilers, and about as static. The direction is wooden and formulaic, and the writing is... well, as juvenile as the onanistic male-fantasy pit that the whole movie came from. I'd say ""Avoid this,"" but the sorts of people who will watch it will watch it regardless of what anybody says. Fair enough. Just remember that 2 hours of your life cannot be regained.","Jul 30, 2022",audience_review

Se esse longa-metragem fosse uma música até mesmo um invertebrado teria excelência em produzir um ritmo melhor (mesmo sem os invertebrados possuírem cérebro). História superficial, lenta/corrida, descartável, presunçosa, ofensiva, indiscreta, machista, aproveitadora e, o mais importante, tediosa. Com atuações dignas de vergonha alheia e aquele mal-estar que corre por nossas entranhas. É uma espécie de tentativa de 50 tons de cinza que acabou caindo em 1000 tons de descarte. A história se resume a um chefe de máfia (o diretor do filme usa todos os artifícios necessários para tentar fazer com que a trama... pode ser chamada de trama? com que a trama seja minimamente interessante. Falhou), sequestra uma mulher e grosseiramente falando, assim como no longa, dá a ela 365 dias para que ela se apaixone por ele. É um nome criativo, não é? É de se impressionar como encaixa o título e o filme, é mais ou menos o equivalente a passar 365 dias sendo açoitado nas partes baixas com um chicote feito de arame farpado, para nossas sorte o filme possuí 1h55min, que é o suficiente para querer nunca ter visto aquela coisa horrenda. Atuações amadoras, filmografia apelativa, roteiro banal e enredo plagiado que possuí a pretensão de lucrar e nada além disso. Por essas e outras o declínio Netflix vem se consolidando no mercado.

Anyway, afterwards I had to clear the palate, so I watched 'I am Wrath', and while that was far more watchable, was it any less objectionable?

365 Days,N/A,"If you like erotic romance you will love this movie dispute some of the annoying flaws. We live in a world where so many movies are violent, bloody, evil and absolutely disgusting yet they get five stars for all this evil! Yes bring on the love! A Man's ardent love for a woman is refreshing to see. Here you have woman desperate to be loved with the Passion she deserves and when tall dark extremely handsome capo kidnaps her of course she not freaking out! there's an excitement in her gut that she cannot explain. When she finally accepts this mans love for her the magic of this all consuming love is expressed. So what of the flaws. Maximo is mafia leader, he should have a right hand man that looks the part. Domenico could have just been a secondary. Laura is too flat chested and it's off putting but as a woman I'm all eyes on him anyways, he's is so very handsome with a smile to melt all hearts and what a voice! Laura's wardrobe was awful. Her blond hair was not well cut! Details are important. Overall the aesthetics in the movie should have been much much better... more expense was needed here and much better music! And seriously the sex scene in the flat in Warsaw was performed against a dirty window. What a shame!! Some sex scenes were rushed in parts but their passion for each other was evident and great to watch. It would have been prudent for them to have made slow love/sex in one of the scenes but hopefully they will do do in the sequel.","Mar 17, 2021",audience_review

365 Days,N/A,"As a movie reviewer, it is good to take the time and watch a bad movie. Now that might sound stupid but it teaches us what not to do when making a movie. So yes, I watched this movie expecting that it was going to be bad, and it was really bad. There are quite a few reasons that this movie is bad so I'll go over each reason separately. Let's start with the actors. It doesn't take an expert to know why they chose Michele Morrone and Anna-Maria Sieklucka to be the lead roles, and it's because they're HOT. And the director knows that they look good so they use their features to appeal to viewers who yearn for a partner. I kid you not, the only people who say they like this movie are the lovesick girls fawning over the actors or the people who watch Fifty Shades of Grey for fun. I don't know if these actors could've done a better job if they didn't have to have an obligatory sex scene every 5 minutes, but what was shown on screen, there wasn't many reasons to be amazed by their performance. I hope to see these actors in a better movie sometime. But speaking of our main characters, let's talk about how Massimo is a sexual predator and how it makes the character of Laura uncompelling. So Massimo wants Laura to love her, so he kidnaps her, locks her in his home where she must stay for 365 days. In these 365 days Laura must decide if she loves him or hates him, and if she still doesn't love him, then she gets to go home. I have a few problems with this scenario. Throw consent right out the window because in the first half of the movie, Massimo is stalking Laura as soon as he sees her for the first time. Soon after, he kidnaps her, locks her in her room, and when she confronts him later, he is physically abusive to Laura, pinning her down on chairs and threatening her. It gets even worse when you start thinking of all the times he raped her, like fingering her on the airplane while she's restrained and even more extreme when he restrains her on a bed where he quite literally was threatening to rape her. I think you get the jist of what I'm trying to explain here, but honestly it's sick. The first concept could have worked thematically if the story was about Laura and her struggle to survive for 365 days, and that it showed what it's like to be a mafia boss's girlfriend or showed the horrors of kidnapping people in general. It would have been an eye opening experience for many people in the world and it would help speak out against kidnapping and sex trafficking. But f*** it, let's make Laura fall in love with him. The amount of problems this brings up is literally too many to count because that simple idea ruins the entire movie from being good, because this concept alone is disgusting. What this movie is suggesting is that it's ok for men to kidnap girls off the street because after a little bit of time, they'll love you unconditionally. Let me repeat. THIS MOVIE SAYS THAT IT'S OK THAT KIDNAPPING PEOPLE IS OK, because the main couple is hApPY. That is beyond stupid. This also makes the character of Laura really REALLY weird. So Laura is kidnapped and after briefly meeting with Massimo she is already pinned down on a chair being threatened. From that moment on, she tries to run from him to no avail TWICE, rejects his sexual advances (which he ignores), and even goes against his wishes. But after Massimo kills a different guy that was trying to rape her, suddenly she's like yeah ok I love you now. Thank you for saving me from getting raped. WHAT??? Yeah, 1 DAY LATER, we are shown a 4 MINUTE montage of them having vigorous sex and really soon after, she agrees to marry him. I'm sorry, but if you are trying to tell a story that wants to make it seem like the mafia boss actually is a good boyfriend, I don't think one act of kindness forgives all the other shit he did. In fact, don't even write the story at all, because I don't think good relationships start off with a kidnapping, or anything else he did... I'm done talking about this, my point has been made. What about the other characters? HA! Gotcha. The side characters don't even matter!!! Soooo, let's move on. If a movie calls itself an erotic and ""steamy"" movie, then most people expect to see some sort of sex on screen. And don't worry, you'll get your share of ""steamy"" content because this movie loves to show you it every 5 minutes. Yes, oh yes, you'll be exposed to tons of sex scenes, which in the grand scheme of the movie… don't even matter. On other scenes that don't matter, don't forget about the absolutely necessary make-over montages where we get to see our lead actress in tons of different wardrobes and fashion styles. I bring this up because this absolutely ruins the pace, because the secondary plot that is supposed to build towards Massimo's ex-girlfriend murdering Laura. Which if one of your main characters is going to be killed off, you'd want to set up the death perfectly while simultaneously making us care about the character. But the extent of the setting up Laura's death is Anna telling Laura that she is going to kill her, and then an hour later Laura dies. Wow, such foreshadowing. Legit, I could not have told you how this movie was going to end, because they were not telling us ANYTHING. I thought it would just end after their wedding but they tried to pull off a really shitty plot twist that makes you roll your eyes. But that's not even the only problem with these meaningless scenes, what is even more obnoxious, is the STUPID SOUNDTRACK! These songs alone make the experience ten times worse because shitty songs make even shittier scenes. And don't forget you'll be hearing these pop songs more than ten times during its two hour runtime. Enjoy. So in review, the acting was meh, the writing was disgustingly awful, the pacing was atrocious, and the soundtrack made my ears bleed. I hate this movie, 0/10.","Jan 15, 2021",audience_review
