The Meg,Alejandro Turdo,"The Meg is an acceptable link in the sharksxplotation chain, recognizing itself as disposable entertainment and knowing its premise isn't the most intelligent but that it's ridiculous enough... [Full review in Spanish]","Aug 7, 2023",critic_review
The Meg,Cory Woodroof,"If you just want a big, dumb movie about a giant shark terrorizing a group of ocean-bound scientists and Jason Statham, you could do a lot worse than The Meg.","Aug 4, 2023",critic_review
The Meg,Manuel São Bento,"If a movie is filled with stereotypical characters, a generic plot, and a bunch of incongruencies, at least own it. This is where The Meg fails to deliver. It does not know what it wants to be...","Jul 24, 2023",critic_review
The Meg,Kate Boyle,"This movie is purely meant to entertain and it does. It’s exciting, intense, had just the right amount of humor.","Mar 8, 2023",critic_review
The Meg,Keith Garlington,"I give the filmmakers credit for not even attempting to hide what they are going for – goofy, preposterous and a whole lot of Jason Statham.","Aug 24, 2022",critic_review
The Meg,Brian Eggert,The overall lack of humor robs the viewer of escapist fun.,"Mar 11, 2022",critic_review
The Meg,Jason Adams,"There is indeed a shark, and there is indeed Jason Statham, and you're already halfway to a movie there so it's not all bad","Feb 25, 2022",critic_review
The Meg,Taylor Baker,Episode 7: Globalism,"Aug 28, 2021",critic_review
The Meg,Kip Mooney,Succeeds because it knows exactly what it is and doesn't try to be more than that.,"Aug 21, 2021",critic_review
The Meg,Richard Crouse,"Its tagline is 'Pleased to eat you.' There is no need for a review. You know exactly what you're getting into here but, because I am paid by the word, here we go.","Mar 4, 2021",critic_review
The Meg,Mike Massie,"Despite the rarity of theatrical shark movies, The Meg consistently underwhelms -- even down to its basest slasher film qualities, such as the restrained amount of beachgoer destruction and the high number of survivors at the conclusion.","Dec 7, 2020",critic_review
The Meg,Dan Buffa,The Meg is a trite and stereotypical mess that is often too silly and predictable for its own good.,"Nov 9, 2020",critic_review
The Meg,Paul McGuire Grimes,Stay home and watch Jaws instead.,"Nov 4, 2020",critic_review
The Meg,Lucy Buglass,The Meg makes no effort to try and explain anything which was frustrating to me.,"Oct 19, 2020",critic_review
The Meg,Andrew Gaudion,"When it comes to comparing it to the other inhabitants that occupy shark movie waters, The Meg is thankfully more akin to Deep Blue Sea than it is Jaws: The Revenge.","Aug 30, 2020",critic_review
The Meg,Jason Fraley,"Turteltaub plays the premise way straighter than you'd expect, treading water between a serious thriller and a tongue-in-cheek ""Sharknado"" spoof, never becoming truly great at either.","Aug 29, 2020",critic_review
The Meg,Matt Cipolla,I was never bored by The Meg -- just constantly underwhelmed.,"Jul 25, 2020",critic_review
The Meg,Alex Hudson,n outrageous romp about a prehistoric shark that succeeds nicely on its modest terms.,"Jul 18, 2020",critic_review
The Meg,Brent McKnight,"Ultimately, The Meg disappoints most because we see what could have been. Somewhere in here there's a pared-down, gore-soaked, R-rated version of this that's amazing. But it certainly isn't this.","Jun 30, 2020",critic_review
The Meg,Steven Prokopy,"As far as giant monster movies go, this one packs a great deal of bite... even without a whole lot of actual biting.","Jun 22, 2020",critic_review
The Meg,Laken G,"This is after many rewatches mind you. I know I'm late to the party but here I am anyways. The MEG gives you some entertaining action, for the concept. Nothing crazy but only things that can be done with this idea. The visuals are amazing though, I wish movies now could look like this. The cast give good performances even though they're dialogue can be interesting. The scores and music are actually pretty good, nothing that will get stuck in your head but stuff that will get the viewing experience to be more enjoyable. Now onto the plot. It actually takes a little bit for the film to start going. But once it does it picks up the pace and does a mostly good job. Overall it's no Jaws but it's something I'm happy we as an audience have been given a chance to sink our teeth into. 6/10","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
The Meg,Anthony G,Jason Statham in all his heroic pageantry. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and aims directly for the summertime entertainment experience.,"Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
The Meg,Andy S,"(I'm Mistletoe Virus I'm saying I love this movie!) Personally, I like Jason Statham, the Meg is one of the summer's most fun, most mindless blockbusters!","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

The Meg,Laura S,Wasn't a fan of the love interest,"Aug 11, 2023",audience_review
The Meg,N/A,"5 years later and it's just okay Turns out it's actually loosely based on the 1997 book Sharks are the deadliest predators to roam the oceans But the Megalodon is the most fierce given it's been around for millions of years since the dinosaurs roamed the earth Funny considering there's so many straight-to-dvd movies that are intentionally bad nothing has been able to match 'Jaws', the closest has been 'The Shallows' John Turteltaub directs a giant summer flick about the scariest one out there starring Jason Statham, Li Bingbing, Ruby Rose, Masi Oka, and Jessica McNamee At the bottom of the Mariana Trench resides a Megalodon that manages to trap a submarine crew in the Pacific Ocean outside of China working for the Mana One research facility A rescue diver Jonas Taylor steps in to save them and find a way to defeat this deadly predator The film is a B movie no doubt with hokey acting, noticeable effects, flat characters, and a huge gaping plothole that will have you scratching your head The humans are okay but it's really the shark that's the real selling point The biggest issue is that it takes so long to get to the creature portions so you're just sitting around waiting for the shark to chow down on stuff It's half underwhelming at best begging to have a trashiness to it if it weren't for that PG-13 rating","Aug 10, 2023",audience_review
The Meg,The Incredible M,better then all the jaws sequels?,"Aug 10, 2023",audience_review
The Meg,Anileh M,"The meg 2 was good action movie with great suspense. Although some of the scenes in this movie including Jonas Statham were not very believable. Nice comedy from here and there, and would be a good movie to watch with children coming of age.","Aug 10, 2023",audience_review

The Meg,Jess F,Puros estereotipos y situaciones absurdas. Pero genial para reírse con la familia de lo mala que es la película.,"Aug 9, 2023",audience_review
The Meg,David W,"It's raises the shark based action himovie to never before seen heights. A very enjoyable modern b-movie which is well acted, has some genuine tension, some funny lines and great shark effects, what more do you want? The Stath is in full effect and all without having to shoot or kick anyone in the head. A great antidote to a stressful day. Just switch off the brain and enjoy the ride with mates and a bucket of popcorn, I liked it a lot.","Aug 9, 2023",audience_review
The Meg,C,Dumb but fun entertainment.,"Aug 7, 2023",audience_review
The Meg,Anubis C,"Awesome movie imo. Pacing is nice, Visuals are great, acting a solid 8/10. Just your avarage action movie with a small plot. Definitely enjoyed it.","Aug 7, 2023",audience_review
The Meg,Ben M,There were a couple good action scenes. The CGI wasn't great. A lot of the dialogue was cheesy.,"Aug 7, 2023",audience_review

They Cloned Tyrone,Craig Mathieson,"It does waver at times, but the laughs are always backed by insightful ideas.","Aug 3, 2023",critic_review

They Cloned Tyrone,Erik Childress,Boyega has to play the film's moral fortitude and does it well but Jamie Foxx and Teyonah Parris give two of the best comic performances of the year and are an absolute delight to watch bounce off each other.,"Aug 1, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Lucas Moore,"Even though it's shot like a Blaxploitation film, at no time does the scope of the film not feel grand. It's a horror/sci-fi film with social commentary that doesn't feel too woke that it takes you out of the pure enjoyment of the film.","Jul 31, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Kit Stone,They Cloned Tyrone is almost too good for its Netflix home. What Taylor delivered for his debut is something of cinematic value.,"Jul 31, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Nick Venable,The fact that it can bring so many past favorites to mind while still maintaining its own identity is a feat unto itself.,"Jul 31, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Eve Tushnet,"This movie is so fun, so joyful in its plunge into a stylized Black cultural world that mixes nostalgia for the bad old Blaxploitation days and hypercontemporary references, that you almost don’t notice how much Afropessimism is in its DNA.","Jul 31, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Alejandro Alemán,"Juel Taylor knows how to deliver a personal, original and fun film. [Full review in Spanish]","Jul 31, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Dennis Schwartz,Ambiguity filters the lines between the truth and fantasy.,"Jul 30, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Jason Fraley,"The mystery can be hard to follow for the first half hour, but if you can stick with it, it really picks up in the second half with a villainous monologue that explains what's going on, a mix of ""Body Snatchers,"" ""Get Out,"" ""Us"" and ""Sorry to Bother You.""","Jul 29, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Mini Anthikad-Chhibber,The actors have a whale of a time in this smartly subversive sci-fi thriller comedy.,"Jul 29, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Tatat Bunnag,"If you like mystery movies that have an element of humour behind them and want to watch one that's totally off the wall, check this out.","Jul 28, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Prabhjot Bains,"Though it doesn't hit all its marks (especially when the plot-oriented second half writes itself into a few illogical corners), They Cloned Tyrone never relinquishes its equally alluring and off-putting charm.","Jul 28, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Brian Costello,"This is a thoughtful and hilarious, if raw and at times profane, sci-fi mystery comedy.","Jul 27, 2023",critic_review
They Cloned Tyrone,Kamaya,Movie of the doggone summer. they’re gonna shake the room with this one.,"Jul 21, 2023",audience_review

The Night of the 12th,Hope Madden,Moll has drawn us into a tragic mystery and left us searching for answers to questions beyond the identity of Clara’s killer.,"Aug 4, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Farah Cheded,"The film’s treatment of the victim herself — incurious and downright gratuitous in the depiction of her murder — cements it as a shallow, un-self-aware, and failed attempt to reckon with a subject that deserved its full focus.","Aug 4, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Christopher Lloyd,"A tense, engaging crime procedural that is stylistically more American than French.","Aug 1, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Roger Moore,"""La Nuit du 12"" tests one's patience the way the case weighs on and tests the detectives.","Jul 29, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Sean P. Means,"Moll investigates the emotional states of the cops as doggedly as those cops investigate Clara’s death.

The Night of the 12th,June Butler,The Night of the Twelfth will give viewers reason to reflect on the inhumanity of innocence and the fragility of life. It’s an astounding film and one that is well worth watching.,"Jun 29, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Laura Clifford,"an unconventional police procedural, one in which an unsolved crime haunts its investigators… emotional callousness begins an array of the violent tendencies of too many men toward women which will weigh upon Yohan.","Jun 27, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Edwin Arnaudin,"The French ""Memories of Murder.""","Jun 27, 2023",critic_review

The Night of the 12th,Filipe Freitas,"It can be frustrating to follow these cops, both locked in their solitude and lost in their leads.","May 24, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Taylor Baker,In The Night of the 12th the film adaptation of the novel 18.3 – Une année à la PJ by Pauline Guéna director Dominik Moll swaps the intrigue that normally permeates detective tales for an authentic portrayal of the day-to-day events and,"May 21, 2023",critic_review

The Night of the 12th,Bilge Ebiri,"Its real-world mysteries eventually become existential ones, but the film never stops sending chills up your spine.","May 19, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Jared Mobarak,This police procedural isn't therefore about justice or heroism or even violence. At least not any one isolated from the others. It's a look at the human condition and its tragic flirtation with futility.,"May 19, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Morgan Rojas,"Composer Olivier Margueri’s score offers a beautiful mix of buoyancy sprinkled with melancholy, giving the film its ominous nature.","May 18, 2023",critic_review
The Night of the 12th,Archie H,The lead character spends most of his time cycling in a circle going nowhere. That's exactly how you feel having watched the film. Pretentious nonsense. Total waste of time.,"Aug 8, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Yuri M,"O filme é excelente. Quase como um documentário, a história é imersiva e convida o telespectador a participar das angústias vividas pelos personagens ali presentes. O arco do protagonista exibe a vida e a rotina de investigações policiais. Promove importantes reflexões a respeito de comportamentos estruturais da sociedade, de forma leve e sem desviar da história. Uma obra prima.","Aug 7, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Ravenswood R,"Excellent police movie. It covers many themes equally well, has sharp characterization and consistently believable scenes and dialogue. It is dark in general but has great vitality in the story and compelling interactions which keep it lively and brisk, even with the long run time and ""slow"" pace. Humor is present, too, if you catch it. Proves that a nice tidy wrap-up and solving of the crime is not what makes a great movie.","Aug 6, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Richa P,Omg what a disappointing movie this was! It takes you through a whole investigation of a murder - the kind of unsolved murder that haunts investigators. And spoiler alert - it remains unsolved till the end! Like why would you pass on that misery to the audience?? How does this movie have an audience rotten tomato score 98%?? This is absolutely insane! Don't watch this movie.,"Aug 6, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Bruce S,"The movie is not so much a Mystery as a Police Procedural. They pretty much tell you so at the beginning of the show. The acting, direction and filming are great. Just remember that it's based on a true story of an unsolved crime. Also, if you're a french language student this film is great for its easy to understand dialog if you're at level B2 or so.","Jul 15, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Primo 1,"A dark, well crafted gripping movie. A hard -boiled, adaptation of french police procedures, laying out a genuine portrayal of the day to day events and the human condition with its tragic seduction with futility.","Jul 7, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Jeffrey M F,"This was well-acted and well-done overall, but European films like this feel very slow for American viewers who are used to a much faster pace to our story telling.","Jul 4, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Onini C,"""The Night Of The 12TH"" is a gripping thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat.

The Night of the 12th,len s,I enjoyed the movie which was based to true events. The acting was good although there were so many characters it was sometimes difficult to remember who was who.

The Night of the 12th,Lucas B,"Very interesting, quite captivating, but I had a little trouble with the rhythm. (Bouli Lanners I love you)","Jun 13, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Ghederick Eshmont,Spectacular crime procedural that avoids the Anglo-American psychological/obsessive troupes. Very adept at showing the bureaucratic nature of law enforcement.,"Jun 12, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Roy J,"Good for fans of police procedurals. Otherwise, a little frustrating on what the movie is trying to say. We know from the start the killer won't be found, so is it because of police incompetence or just how life is.","Jun 11, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Tyler G,"Understated and well acted crime investigation movie. Opts for realism over resolution, personal dynamics over standard procedural. The gender commentary overt in the dialogues bridging between multiple scenes and characters felt a bit forced. Overall, okay.","Jun 7, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,eduardo b,"Very good movie, great discussion. A must watch!","May 23, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Jon T,Excellent. I am 67 so seen a lifetime of cop movies/tv shows. This is the best of them if you like realism. Can't say too much about it without giving it away.,"Apr 16, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Natalia R,"It's an excellent and intriguing movie -- Dominik Moll's best movie. Based on the true police investigation of the murder of Maud Maréchal, in Lagny sur Marne -- a suburb outside Paris. The murder took place 10 years ago, May 14 2013. Dominik melanges incriminating evidence and characteristics of all suspects -- perhaps to distract attention from the main suspect and murderer who is still at large -- hopefully not for long. It's based on the book written by Pauline Guéna, 18.3 Une année à PJ. The chapter ""Une vraie victime"" talks about the investigation of Maud Maréchal's murder. In the book her name is Clara, same as in the movie. Pauline spent one year at the police of Versailles headquarters studying police investigations. The Night of the 12 got six Césars this year. Best director, best movie, best adapted screenplay, most promising actor, best supporting actor and best film score.","Apr 8, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Alistair M,Intriguing and movie kept me fully engrossed,"Apr 6, 2023",audience_review
The Night of the 12th,Phil S,"This is a plausible and well-controlled procedural. It's no spoiler to say that this is a procedure without a positive outcome. That's the premise of the film from the start. But it mixes extreme violence and thoughtful conversations, which are refreshingly naturalistic. There are some excellent scenes which are unhurried, though the film never drags.","Mar 28, 2023",audience_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Lucas Moore,Rocket's origin story is great and the only highlight of the movie. Tonally it's all over the place and the runtime is about 25 minutes too long.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Manuel São Bento,"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an emotionally powerful, tear-inducing ""farewell"" to James Gunn and his Guardians.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Matthew Creith,"While the first two ""Guardians"" films might have been about Peter and the Guardians coming together, ""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" is about the search for one's true identity and contribution to the greater good.","Jul 25, 2023",critic_review
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Courtney Lanning,"""Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" shows [Marvel] still has fuel in the tank and is capable of making good movies.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Zach Pope,"Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol 3 is endearing, heartfelt, hilarious, but most of all everything you want from a finale I cried, I laughed, & I feel completely satisfied! Gunn has delivered the perfect finale & one of the best trilogies","Jul 22, 2023",critic_review
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Sarah Ward,"This farewell to part of the MCU always feels like a zippy, self-contained Guardians of the Galaxy movie, rather than a placeholder for more and more future franchise instalments.","Jul 22, 2023",critic_review
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,David Griffiths,Everything comes together for this one – a brilliant screenplay from Gunn and his team of writers and a cast that seem to bring their best in what maybe some of their final times playing the characters that many cinema fans have come to know and love.,"Jul 21, 2023",critic_review
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Lauren Veneziani,"Emotionally manipulative, too much CGI, and not nearly as fun as the first Guardians of the Galaxy film.","Jul 20, 2023",critic_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Yasser Medina,"An entertaining sequel that once again showcases Marvel's cosmic side with a fast-paced adventure set in a space populated by action, humor, and wacky heroes listening to a greatest hits soundtrack to save the galaxy. [Full review in Spanish]","Jul 9, 2023",critic_review
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,John Serba,"It’s Gunn’s heart that shines brightest, though. His characters squabble like family but function wholly out of love for each other, which is precisely the thing that cuts through all the seemingly Marvel-mandated rigamarole.","Jul 7, 2023",critic_review
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Victor Stiff,"Gunn refuses to give his characters the type of obvious resolutions fandom pines for. Instead, he’s crafted the bitter-sweet ending his characters deserve.","Jun 30, 2023",critic_review
Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,Vera Wylde,"There's a whole bunch of nit-picky stuff that kept pulling me out of the movie, that I may well be the only one who cares about it, and the only one whose viewing experience was particularly hampered by these things.","Jun 28, 2023",critic_review

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,PopcornBabe,"I loved this movie and plan on watching it again as soon as it is available to stream. This is probably my favorite of the Guardians of the Galaxy movies so far. The psychology in the movie is well done. The stakes in the movie are high, the characters, tone, and emotional turmoil of the movie are well done. The movie is very engaging and very good at invoking the intended emotions for a given scene. I know multiple people who shed tears while watching this movie. As a bonus, I that more character background details were revealed. I will say that this is a movie I recommend more for adults than children, and if you are sensitive to certain types of trauma-related content in movies maybe check out a parental guide prior to watching to see if this is a movie that may be too much for you. Some of the characters or portrayed as being in certain types of traumatic, life-or-death, and/or abusive situations.","Jul 22, 2023",audience_review

River Wild,Frank Swietek,"Less a remake of the starry 1994 film than a simpler, bare-bones take on the premise of malevolence during a white-water rafting trip, “River Wild” is an efficiently-made but flimsy potboiler about a berserk killer that’s notable only for its location.","Aug 5, 2023",critic_review

River Wild,Stenko M,"""River Wild,"" the highly anticipated film of 2023, unfortunately falls short of the excitement and thrill one would expect from a riveting adventure movie. While the premise held promise, the execution left much to be desired, resulting in a lackluster cinematic experience. The film follows the story of a daring river rafting trip taken by a group of friends seeking an adrenaline rush in the heart of nature. With its stunning landscapes and potentially intense water sequences, ""River Wild"" had the potential to be an edge-of-your-seat adventure. However, the plot fails to harness the tension that should come naturally from such a perilous journey. The character development was a missed opportunity as well. The main cast had the potential to be multidimensional and compelling, but their actions and motivations often felt contrived and forced. This made it difficult to fully invest in their fates, rendering several pivotal scenes emotionally unimpactful. The pacing of the film was another major issue. It struggled to find a balance between building suspense and advancing the plot. As a result, certain scenes dragged on unnecessarily, while others crucial for character development seemed rushed and underdeveloped. Visually, ""River Wild"" had moments of beauty, capturing the grandeur of the natural landscapes. However, these moments were fleeting, often overshadowed by inconsistent cinematography that failed to create a coherent visual tone for the film. Even the usually reliable soundtrack felt disconnected from the events on-screen. At times, it attempted to create tension, but more often than not, it seemed out of sync with the unfolding scenes, further detracting from the overall experience. While ""River Wild"" attempted to combine the elements of a suspenseful adventure and a character-driven drama, it ultimately struggled to find its identity. The potential was there, but the execution faltered, resulting in a film that left me feeling unsatisfied and detached from the story. In conclusion, ""River Wild"" falls short of its promise, failing to deliver the gripping adventure it advertised. With a weak plot, underdeveloped characters, and inconsistent pacing, the film struggles to engage its audience. While it's not entirely without merit, it's certainly not the cinematic thrill ride one would hope for in a 2023 adventure film.","Aug 11, 2023",audience_review

For example, the antagonist in the film at one point is asleep holding a gun. If you want him to stop, I don’t know maybe knock him out unconscious and then take the antagonist’s gun. Then he’s no longer a threat. But, the film doesn’t seem smart enough to have characters that think like this. Could’ve been better.","Aug 10, 2023",audience_review

Medusa Deluxe,Alan W,"Writer-director Thomas Hardiman's debut is an original and strangely compelling murder mystery set in a regional hairdressing competition in Northern England. When one of the competitors is found dead with his head scalped, speculations and suspicions grow amongst the other hairdressers and the models in the aftermath as they circulate within the industrial labyrinth of corridors, staircases and dressing rooms they find themselves unwittingly confined in. Seamlessly melding his long takes together into a film that looks like it was shot in one single take, essentially by alternating between talking and walking scenes to propel the film from one place to the other, Hardiman is in showing off mode but this also lends the film a tight, rhythmic pacing as the narrative unfolds in real time, accompanied by a sparse, pulsating and eerie score that would have worked just as well for a serial killer movie. Whatever you think of the ending, and some will find it too frothy, his screenplay demonstrates an appealing campy sense of humour and a knack for quality banter that drives the plot forward and keeps the film's momentum going while a mostly unknown but familiar-looking cast proficiently delivers the red herrings and other distractions. Even though I wouldn't have mind if the film drops the one-take premise for the final scenes for a clearer explanation of its ending, you have to admire its moxie for sticking to its gun all the way to the bitter end. Of course, this is merely just silly, frivolous fun but it's also a technically accomplished film and a great calling card for Hardiman who shows promise, confidence and enough artistic flair to finish with a cheeky disco number that could be as much a tribute to Claire Denis as it is to Mamma Mia the Movie.","Jun 22, 2023",audience_review

The colorful detailed shots of Taipei beautifully showcased the city and had me salivating with all the impeccable food shots. A fun soundtrack added great energy to a mellow, yet poignant comedy. Even though I felt some of the deeper book moments weren't completely translated onscreen, I still genuinely enjoyed watching it. Even found myself wishing I had a movie like this growing up, reminiscing back to those transformative years of early adulthood. Representation matters and the relatability of the various characters still resonated through.
